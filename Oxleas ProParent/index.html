                                    A health visitor is a <strong>qualified nurse who has had extra training. Part of their role is to help families avoid illness and stay healthy, especially families with babies and young children.</strong> Health visitors are part of a team that offers screening and developmental checks as part of the<strong> Healthy Child Programme.</strong><br />
                                    A health visitor will usually <strong>visit you for the first time&nbsp; in pregnancy between 28- 34 weeks and around 10 -14 days after your baby is born.</strong> After that, you will see your health visitor at the<strong> child health clinic,</strong> although you can ask to see them at any time.<strong> If </strong></span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/bringing-up-child-alone.aspx', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">you&rsquo;re on your own or struggling</a></span></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>, your health visitor will probably come to see whether you need any help.</strong><br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>Talk to your health visitor or a member of your team if you feel anxious, depressed or worried. </strong>They can give you advice and suggest where to find help. They may also be able to put you in touch with groups where you can meet other mothers.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Your health visitor can visit you at home or you can see them at your<strong> child health clinic, GP surgery or health centre,</strong> depending on where they&rsquo;re based. Your health visitor will <strong>make sure you&rsquo;ve got their phone number.</strong><br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">One early miscarriage is unlikely to affect your chances of having a baby in the future. If you have three or more early miscarriages in a row, you should be referred to a specialist for further investigations. However, sometimes no clear cause can be found.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Both women and men can find it difficult to come to terms with a miscarriage at any stage. You will almost certainly feel a sense of loss. You&#39;ll need time to grieve over the lost baby just as you would over the death of anyone close to you, especially if the miscarriage has happened later in your pregnancy.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You may feel shocked, distressed, angry or just numb. You may feel guilty, wondering whether your miscarriage was caused by anything you did or did not do. It is important to know that, whatever the cause, miscarriage is never anyone&#39;s fault. If a miscarriage is going to happen, there is very little that anyone can do to stop it.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Some people find it helps to have something to remember their baby by. In early pregnancy you might be able to have a picture of a scan. If you have a late miscarriage you may be able to see and hold your baby if you wish. You might also be able to take photographs, footprints and handprints as a keepsake. Some hospitals offer parents a certificate to commemorate their baby. This is done because there is no formal registration of a baby who dies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Talk about your feelings with your partner and those close to you. You might also want to contact The Miscarriage Association or Sands (Stillbirth &amp; neonatal death charity).They can give you information and put you in touch with other women who have experienced a miscarriage.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Healthtalk online has videos and written interviews of women talking about their experiences of miscarriage.&nbsp;</span>

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">All hospitals must offer women at least two ultrasound scans during their pregnancy. The first is usually when you are around 8-14 weeks pregnant and is sometimes called the dating scan, because it estimates when the baby is due (the estimated date of delivery, or EDD).<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    The second scan usually takes place between 18 weeks and 21 weeks. It&#39;s called the anomaly scan because it checks for structural abnormalities (anomalies) in the baby.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Ultrasound scans use sound waves to build a picture of the baby in the womb. The scans are completely painless, have no known side effects on mothers or babies and can be carried out at any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or obstetrician about any concerns you have.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    The scans may detect some serious structural abnormalities so you should be prepared for that information, although the majority of scans show that the baby is developing normally.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    The dating scan and anomaly scan are offered to all women, but not everyone chooses to have them. Your choice will be respected if you decide not to have the scans, and you&#39;ll be given the chance to discuss it with your maternity team before making your decision.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Q: What is pre-eclampsia and what are the warning signs?</strong></span><br />
                        <div data-role="collapsible-set" class="collapsible-highlight">
                            <div data-role="collapsible">
                                <h3>Answer</h3>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">During pregnancy your blood pressure and urine will be checked at every antenatal appointment. This is because a rise in blood pressure or protein in the urine can be the first sign of pre-eclampsia. Although pre-eclampsia usually presents as high blood pressure (pregnancy-induced hypertension) and protein in the urine (pre-eclamptic toxaemia), it can present in other ways (see symptoms of pre-eclampsia).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Pre-eclampsia is life-threatening for mother and baby if left untreated. That is why routine antenatal checks are so important to look for pregnancy-induced hypertension and protein in your urine (proteinuria).<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong><u>Symptoms of pre-eclampsia </u></strong>
                                    <br />
                                    Pre-eclampsia rarely happens before 20th week of pregnancy. Most cases occur in the third trimester (from week 27 to the birth of the baby).<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>Early symptoms</strong><br />
                                    Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia develop the following symptoms first:</span><br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">high blood pressure (hypertension)</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">proteinuria (protein in the urine)</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">You probably won&#39;t notice these symptoms, but your GP or midwife should pick them up during your antenatal appointments.</span>&nbsp;<br />
                                <br />
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">High blood pressure affects 10-15% of all pregnant women, so this alone does not suggest pre-eclampsia. However, the presence of protein in the urine is a good indicator of the condition.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />

                                    As pre-eclampsia develops, it can cause fluid retention (oedema), which often causes sudden swelling of the feet, ankles, face and hands.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Oedema is another common symptom of pregnancy, but it tends to be in the lower parts of the body, such as the feet and ankles. It will gradually build up during the day. If the swelling is sudden, and it particularly affects the face and hands, it could be pre-eclampsia.<br />

                                    The main sign of pre-eclampsia in the unborn baby is slow growth. This is caused by poor blood supply through the placenta to the baby.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    The growing baby receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients than it should, which can affect development. This is called intra-uterine growth restriction, or intra-uterine growth retardation.</span><br />

                                    There is good evidence that pregnant women have a higher chance of developing complications if they get flu, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. One of the most common complications of flu is bronchitis, a chest infection that can become serious and develop into pneumonia. Other complications are not common, but include:<br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Getting vaccinated while you&rsquo;re pregnant may help to protect your baby from developing whooping cough in his or her first few weeks of life. The immunity you get from the vaccine will pass to your baby through the placenta. Babies are not vaccinated against whooping cough until they are two months old.</span><br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Try not to let it bother you, and don&#39;t worry that it will harm your baby &ndash; it won&#39;t. If you can, nap during the day, and get some early nights during the week. Avoid tea, coffee or cola drinks in the evening as the caffeine can make it harder to go to sleep.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Try to relax before bedtime so that you&#39;re not too wide awake. Relaxation techniques may also help. Your antenatal classes may teach relaxation techniques, or you could borrow a relaxation tape, CD or DVD from your library.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You could join an antenatal yoga class or pilates class. Make sure the instructor knows that you are pregnant. Exercise can help you to feel less tired, so even if you&#39;re feeling tired during the day, try to get some activity, such as a walk at lunchtime or going swimming. If the lack of sleep is bothering you, talk to your partner, a friend, doctor or midwife.<br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">A birth plan is a record of what you would like to happen during your labour and after the birth. You don&#39;t have to create a birth plan, but if you would like one your midwife will be able to help. Discussing a birth plan with your midwife will give you the chance to ask questions and find out more about what happens in labour. It also gives your midwife the chance to get to know you better and understand your feelings and priorities.<br />

                                    The main signs of labour starting are strong, regular contractions, and a &lsquo;show&rsquo;. A show is when the plug of mucus from your cervix comes away. Other signs that you are going into labour can include your waters breaking (rupture of the membranes), backache and an urge to go to the toilet caused by your baby&rsquo;s head pressing in your bowel.</span><br />

It&#39;s also helpful for whoever is going to be with you during your labour to know about the different options, as well as how they can support you. Ask your midwife or doctor to explain what&#39;s available so that you can decide what&#39;s best for you.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Write down your wishes in your birth plan, but remember that you should keep an open mind. You may find that you want more pain relief than you&#39;d planned, or your doctor or midwife may suggest more effective pain relief to help the delivery. Different ways of relieving the pain are listed below. You can read them all or use the links below to go straight to any topic:&nbsp;</span>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">There are three stages to labour:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">the first stage, when your contractions make your cervix gradually open up (dilate). This is usually the longest stage.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">the second stage is when your cervix is fully open. This is the part of labour where you help your baby move through your vagina by pushing with your contractions. </span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">the third stage, is after the birth of your baby, when your womb contracts and causes the placenta to come out through the vagina.</span></li>

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Haemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in or around the rectum and anus.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    In most cases, haemorrhoids are mild and some people do not experience any symptoms. In more severe cases, symptoms may include:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">bleeding after passing a stool (the blood will be bright red)</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">a pile may move down, outside of the anus (prolapse) and may need to be pushed back after passing a stool</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">itchiness around the anus</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                    <br />
                                    Haemorrhoids are sometimes caused by prolonged constipation. If you strain when you go to the toilet it can put pressure on the blood vessels in and around your anus, causing them to swell.&nbsp;<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Things that increase the risk of piles include:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;<strong>Treating piles </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Haemorrhoid symptoms often settle down after a few days without treatment. However, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Making lifestyle changes to keep your stools soft and regular is usually the first recommendation for treating piles.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Eating wholegrain bread and cereal and fruit and vegetables will increase fibre in your diet and you should also drink plenty of water.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    If your haemorrhoid symptoms are severe, there are a number of treatment options available to remove them.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    For example, banding is a procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off within seven days.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Surgery is also sometimes recommended to treat large haemorrhoids</span>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Babies only need a bath two or three times a week, but if your baby really enjoys it, bathe them every day.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Don&rsquo;t bathe your baby straight after a feed or when they&rsquo;re hungry or tired. Make sure the room is warm. Have everything you need at hand: a baby bath or washing-up bowl filled with warm water, two towels, baby bath liquid (unless your baby has particularly dry skin), a clean nappy, clean clothes and cotton wool.</span><br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">The water should be warm, not hot. Check it with your wrist or elbow and mix it well so there are no hot patches.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Hold your baby on your knee and clean their face, following the instructions given under &lsquo;Washing&rsquo;</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Next, wash their hair with water or a liquid soap or shampoo that&#39;s designed for babies. Rinse carefully, supporting them over the bowl.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Once you&rsquo;ve dried their hair gently, you can take off their nappy, wiping away any mess.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Lower your baby gently into the bowl or bath using one hand to hold their upper arm and support their head and shoulders.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Keep your baby&rsquo;s head clear of the water. Use the other hand to gently swish the water over your baby without splashing.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Never leave your baby alone in the bath, not even for a second.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Lift your baby out and pat them dry, paying special attention to the creases in their skin.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">This is a good time to massage some oil or cream (not aqueous cream) into your baby&rsquo;s skin. Don&rsquo;t use anything that contains peanut oil as some babies are allergic to it. Lots of babies love being massaged, and it can help them relax and sleep. It&rsquo;s best if you lay your baby on a towel on the floor as both the baby and your hands can get slippery.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">If your baby seems frightened of bathing and cries, try bathing together. Make sure the water isn&rsquo;t too hot. It&rsquo;s easier if someone else holds your baby while you get in and out of the bath.</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">For the first six months your baby should be in the same room as you when they&#39;re asleep, both day and night. Particularly in the early weeks, you may find that your baby only falls asleep in your or your partner&#39;s arms, or when you&#39;re standing by the cot.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You can start getting your baby used to going to sleep without you comforting them by putting them down before they fall asleep or when they&rsquo;ve just finished a feed.&nbsp;It may be easier to do this once your baby starts to stay alert more frequently or for longer.</span><br />

                                    <br />
                                    Babies grow very quickly. All you need for the first few weeks are enough clothes to make sure that your baby will be warm and clean.<br />
                                    You&rsquo;ll probably need:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">two cardigans, wool or cotton rather than nylon, and light rather than heavy &ndash; several light layers of clothing are best for keeping your baby warm</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">four vests</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">a shawl or blanket to wrap your baby in</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">a wool or cotton hat, mittens, and socks or bootees for going out if the weather is cold &ndash; it&rsquo;s better to choose close-knitted patterns rather than those with a loose knit, so that your baby&#39;s fingers and toes won&#39;t get caught</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">a sun hat for going out if it&#39;s hot or the sun is bright</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                    For the first few months, you&#39;ll need a crib, a carry cot or a Moses basket (a light, portable bassinet). Your baby needs to sleep somewhere that&#39;s safe, warm and not too far from you.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    If you are borrowing a crib or a cot, or using one that has been used by another of your children, you should ideally buy a new mattress. If you can&#39;t do this, use the cot mattress you have, as long as it is firm (not soft), flat, fits the cot with no gaps, is clean, and waterproof.<br />
                                    You will need:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">a firm mattress that fits the cot snugly without leaving spaces round the edges, so that your baby cannot trap their head and suffocate</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">sheets to cover the mattress &ndash; you need at least four because they need to be changed often (fitted sheets make life easier but they are quite expensive, so you could use pieces of old sheet)</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">light blankets for warmth</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;<br />

                                    <br />
                                    Spend some time looking at what&#39;s available for getting around with your baby. Think about what will suit you best before you make a choice, and ask other mums what they&#39;ve found useful. Before buying a pushchair or a pram, check that:&nbsp;</span>

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">We all know that playing is fun. It&rsquo;s also the most effective way for children to learn. By playing, children can practise all the skills they&rsquo;ll need as they grow up.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    To grow and develop, children need time and attention from someone who&rsquo;s happy to play with them. Gradually, they&rsquo;ll learn to entertain themselves for some of the time.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    It can be hard to find the time to play with your child, especially when there there are many other things you need to do. The solution can be to find ways to involve your child in what you&rsquo;re doing, even the housework. Children learn from everything they do and everything that&rsquo;s going on around them.&nbsp;</span>

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">By making what you&rsquo;re doing fun and interesting for your child, you can get your household jobs done while they&rsquo;re learning.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Have times when you focus completely on your child. Talk about anything and everything, even the washing-up or what to put on the shopping list. By sharing as much as possible your child will pick up lots of new words.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Give your child plenty of opportunities to use their body by running, jumping and climbing, especially if you don&rsquo;t have much room at home.</span></li>

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Find other people who can spend time with your child when you really need to focus on something else.</span></li>

                                    If you&rsquo;re concerned that your child has special educational needs (that is, you think they might need extra help at school) talk to a health professional who already knows you and your child, such as your health visitor.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You or any of the professionals involved in caring for your child can ask your local authority to carry out a statutory assessment of your child. After this, the local authority will decide whether to issue a statement. This will describe any extra support that your child will need at school.<br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">When children first start walking it&rsquo;s normal for them to walk with their feet apart and to waddle. It&rsquo;s also common for young children to appear bow-legged or knock-kneed, or walk with their toes turned in or out. Most minor foot problems in children correct themselves, but talk to your GP or health visitor if you&#39;re concerned about any of the following conditions.<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Bow legs</b>. &nbsp;Before the age of two most children have a small gap between their knees and ankles when they stand. If the gap is pronounced or doesn&#39;t correct itself, check with your GP or health visitor. This could be a sign of rickets (a bone deformity), although this is very rare.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Knock knees.</b> This is when a child stands with their knees together and there&#39;s a gap between their ankles. Between the ages of two and four a gap of up to 6cm (around 2.5 inches) is considered normal. Knock knees usually correct themselves by the age of six. See Knock knee for more information.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>In-toeing</b>. Also known as pigeon-toes. This is where a child&rsquo;s feet turn in. The condition usually corrects itself by the age of eight or nine, and treatment is not usually needed.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Out-toeing</b>. This is where the feet point outwards. Again, this usually corrects itself and treatment isn&#39;t needed in most cases.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Flat feet</b>. If your child appears to have flat feet, don&#39;t worry. If an arch forms when your child stands on tiptoe no treatment will normally be needed.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Tiptoe walking</b>. If your child mostly walks on tiptoe talk to your GP or health visitor.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>First shoes</strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    The feet of children under five grow very fast, and it&rsquo;s important that the bones grow straight. The bones in a baby&rsquo;s toes are soft at birth. If they&rsquo;re cramped by tight shoes or socks they can&rsquo;t straighten out and grow properly.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Your child won&rsquo;t need proper shoes until they&rsquo;re walking on their own. Even then, shoes can be kept for outside walking only, at least at first. It&rsquo;s important that shoes and socks are the right size.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Shoes with laces, a buckle or a velcro fastening are good because they hold the heel in place and stop the foot slipping forward and damaging the toes. If the heel of a shoe slips off when your child stands on tiptoe, it&#39;s too big.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    If possible, buy shoes made from natural materials such as leather, cotton or canvas, as these materials allow air to circulate. Plastic shoes make feet sweaty and can rub and cause fungal infections. Cotton socks are best.</span><br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">These tips may help:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Give your child the same food as the rest of the family, but remember not to add salt to your child&#39;s food. Check the label of any food product you use to make family meals.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Eat your meals together if possible.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Give small portions and praise your child for eating, even if they only manage a little.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">If your child rejects the food, don&rsquo;t force them to eat it. Just take the food away without comment. Try to stay calm even if it&rsquo;s very frustrating.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Don&rsquo;t leave meals until your child is too hungry or tired to eat.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Your child may be a slow eater so be patient.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Don&rsquo;t give too many snacks between meals. Limit them to a milk drink and some fruit slices or a small cracker with a slice of cheese, for example.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">It&rsquo;s best not to use food as a reward. Your child may start to think of sweets as nice and vegetables as nasty. Instead, reward them with a trip to the park or promise to play a game with them.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Children sometimes get thirst and hunger mixed up. They might say they&rsquo;re thirsty when really they&rsquo;re hungry.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Make mealtimes enjoyable and not just about eating. Sit down and chat about other things.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">If you know any other children of the same age who are good eaters, ask them round for tea. A good example can work well, as long as you don&rsquo;t talk too much about how good the other children are.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Ask an adult that your child likes and looks up to to eat with you. Sometimes a child will eat for someone else, such as a grandparent, without any fuss.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Children&rsquo;s tastes change. One day they&rsquo;ll hate something, but a month later they may love it.</span></li>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><u><strong>From 12 months</strong></u><br />
                                    <br />
                                    Your baby will now be eating three meals a day, chopped if required, plus breast milk or whole cows&rsquo; milk and healthier snacks like fruit, vegetable sticks, toast and rice cakes.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    They can now drink whole cows&rsquo; milk. Choose full-fat dairy products because children under two need the extra fat and vitamins found in them. From two years old if they are a good eater and growing well they can have semi-skimmed milk. From five years old 1% fat and skimmed milk is OK.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    <br />
                                    Caring for an ill or disabled child can be physically and emotionally tough, and you may find it helpful to talk to parents in a similar situation. Being able to get support from other parents and to offer support where possible will help you to feel less isolated.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You may be able to contact other parents through support groups that are based on specific conditions, or through local carers centres.<br />
                                    Support groups operate online, face to face or both. Choose whichever type of support you feel most comfortable with.<br />
                                    You can find details of carers support groups in your area by searching the directory of local carers&rsquo; services in Services near you.<br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Leave a potty where your child can see it and can get to know what it&rsquo;s for. If you&rsquo;ve got an older child, your younger child may see them using it, which will be a great help. It helps to let your child see you using the toilet and explain what you&rsquo;re doing.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">If your child regularly has a bowel movement at the same time each day, leave their nappy off and suggest that they go in the potty. If your child is even the slightest bit upset by the idea, just put the nappy back on and leave it a few more weeks before trying again.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">As soon as you see that your child knows when they&rsquo;re going to pee, encourage them to use their potty. If your child slips up, just mop it up and wait for next time. It takes a while to get the hang of it. If you don&rsquo;t make a fuss when they have an accident then they won&rsquo;t feel anxious and worried and are more likely to be successful the next time.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Your child will be delighted when he or she succeeds. A little praise from you will help a lot. It can be quite tricky to get the balance right between giving praise and making a big deal out of it, which you don&rsquo;t want to do. Don&#39;t give sweets as a reward, as that can end up causing more problems. When the time is right, your child will want to use the potty and they will just be happy to get it right.</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><u>Teaching your child the everyday essentials </u>
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    When children play, they&rsquo;re learning what they want to learn. Often these will be things you want them to learn too.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Sometimes, though, they may need some extra help from you. For example, when they&rsquo;re learning to use a potty (see How to potty train for more information), how to wash and dress themselves or what not to touch and where it&rsquo;s not safe to run.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    The following suggestions can make life easier for both of you:&nbsp;<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Wait until you think your child is ready. If you try to teach them something too soon, you&rsquo;ll both end up getting frustrated. If you try teaching them something and it doesn&rsquo;t work out, leave it for a few weeks and try again.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Don&rsquo;t make it into a big deal. Your child might learn to eat with a spoon very quickly but still want to be fed when they&rsquo;re tired. They might use the potty a few times then want to go back to nappies. Don&rsquo;t worry. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve failed. It won&rsquo;t take them long to realise that they want to learn to be grown up and independent.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Keep them safe. Children under three can&rsquo;t understand why they shouldn&rsquo;t fiddle with electrical goods or breakable objects. It&rsquo;s easier to keep things you don&rsquo;t want touched well out of their way.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Be encouraging. Your child wants to please you. If you give them a big smile, a cuddle or praise when they do something right, they&rsquo;re much more likely to do it again. This works a lot better than telling them off for doing something wrong.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Be realistic. Don&#39;t expect perfection or instant results. If you assume everything is going to take a bit longer than you thought, you will be pleasantly surprised if it doesn&#39;t.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Set an example. Your child wants to be like you and do what you do. Let them see you washing, brushing your teeth and using the loo.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Be firm. Children need firm, consistent guidelines. Once you&rsquo;ve made a decision, stick to it. For example, if you start potty training but decide your child isn&rsquo;t ready, it&rsquo;s fine to give up and try again a few weeks later. But a child who&rsquo;s in nappies one day, out of them the next day and back in them the day after is bound to get confused.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Be consistent. For the same reason, it&rsquo;s important that everyone who looks after your child teaches them the same things in more or less the same way. If you and your partner, or you and your childminder, do things very differently, your child won&rsquo;t learn as easily.</span></li>
                                    <li>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Children do learn to talk at different rates, and there is a lot of variation in &lsquo;typical&rsquo; development.&nbsp; However, development tends to happen in a particular order.&nbsp; We also know what most children of a certain age are likely to be doing.&nbsp; You can find out more about what most children are doing at each age in the &lsquo;Ages and Stages section of Talking Point.&nbsp; If you are at all concerned, you should contact your local speech and language therapist (SLT) and talk to them about your child; they will talk through the options available.&nbsp; You might find it useful to look at the &#39;I CAN&#39; website as there are lots of resources for supporting your child to learn to talk available there.&nbsp;<br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Lots of children like dummies as they help them settle down to sleep or to soothe them. There are however lots of disadvantages in using dummies. This includes the impact on the development of speech and language. When a baby or young child has a dummy in their mouth, they are less likely to copy sounds adults make or to attempt to babble and play with sounds themselves. Playing with sounds and babbling are important in the development of speech skills. Even when children are playing, they are making sounds and their parents will be responding to these. That is how children learn to communicate. If they are not doing that because they are sucking, it might stop them communicating with their parents.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    There is also research that shows that long term dummy use can cause ear infections and affect the development of the jaw. So, ideally it is better not to use a dummy at all. But if your daughter would find this too difficult, just keep her dummy for sleep times, that way she can learn to talk as well as possible.</span><br />

They think he doesn&rsquo;t understand very well. What other signs could I look out for?</strong></span><br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Your son&rsquo;s nursery may well be right. Often children who have difficulty understanding language are better at the things that don&rsquo;t rely on words, like puzzles and physical activities. They frequently have difficulty with activities where lots of words are used, like stories.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    There are other signs that we can notice when a child doesn&rsquo;t understand, including:</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">They make little, slow or no response when someone speaks to them.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">You might need to repeat an instruction several times and make it much simpler before they respond.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">They often rely on visual information to get things right, for example watching others to find out what an instruction means.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">They might &lsquo;switch off&rsquo; when someone is talking to them so you can tell they are not listening.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">They may have difficulties using words and sentences of their own.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Children can get frustrated when they cannot understand, and find it hard to stay involved in activities with lots of words. This can look like disruptive behaviour, but is actually often a sign that a child is struggling with the language. Talk to a speech and language therapist and find out about getting your son assessed. This will tell you more information about what your son can and can&rsquo;t understand.</span><br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">There is no evidence that says speaking in more than one language will cause problems with speech and language development. In fact, bilingualism can help children&rsquo;s learning because they can think about their ideas in both languages.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Being bilingual does not mean a child will learn to speak later, however some children (whether bilingual or not) do learn to speak later than others.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    It is a good idea to use the language/s you would naturally use at home because this will help them communicate at home, as well as learning English for school and other places.</span>

                                <h3>Answer</h3>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Learning to talk is a complicated process and no children get it right straight away. Young children often stop, pause, start again and stumble over words when they are learning to talk. This is normal. Children will often repeat words and phrases (or say things like &lsquo;um um&rsquo;) and hesitate whilst they are sorting out what they want to say. This can go on even up until they start school.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You need to keep watching how your daughter is talking. If she carries on finding it difficult to talk, or seems to be continually getting stuck, or repeating parts of words, you should talk to a speech and language therapist. They will be able to assess your daughter and offer advice about how you can help.&nbsp;</span><br />

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Children learn to talk at different rates. Although there is quite a lot of variation, there are things that children are usually able to do by certain ages. By the time a child is 3 they have normally started to put words together into short sentences, usually with about 4-5 words in. They will ask lots of questions and enjoy learning new words. They will use action words as well as naming words. You can find out more information about what your child should be doing in the &lsquo;Ages and Stages&rsquo; section of Talking Point.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    You do need to talk to someone about your daughter&rsquo;s speech as she does not seem to be talking in the way we would expect for her age. You can contact your local speech and language therapist for advice.</span><br />

                        <div data-role="collapsible-set" class="collapsible-highlight">

                                <h3>Answer</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">It is very important that your child gets a good education &ndash; in his first language and in his second language. If you talk to your child at home in your first language, continue to do so. It is very important that you can communicate with your child well. Use the language that you feel most comfortable with &ndash; if you try to talk to your child in a language you don&#39;t speak very well yourself then he won&#39;t learn to communicate very well either!<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    If your child has difficulties in learning both their first language and English, then it may be that they have more of a speech, language or communication need. Because English is an additional language, it is sometimes hard for teachers to recognise these difficulties. If you are concerned, get help and advice or find local services.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    To help your child, find a community group for your child to join. These groups may be in his first language or English, but may be useful in supporting communication and social development as well as perhaps his school work.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    If your child would benefit from some additional support in the local community or at school, find them a mentor. A mentor is a trusted adult that speaks his first language and who can help him with learning English and that can be another shoulder to lean on. There are organisations that can help to find a mentor. Ask the school or local community organisations.</span><br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>Antenatal care is the care you receive from healthcare professionals during your pregnancy.</strong> The purpose of antenatal care is to monitor your health, your baby&rsquo;s health and support you to make plans which are right for you. <strong>You can refer to the Department of Health Pregnancy Book by accessing</strong> <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.dh.gov.uk/', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">www.dh.gov.uk</a>.<br />
                            You will be offered a series of appointments with a midwife, GP or sometimes an obstetrician (a doctor specialising in pregnancy and birth).</span><br />

                            <br />
                            The Health Visitor comes to see you when your pregnancy is <strong>between 28-36 weeks.</strong><br />
                            <strong>An important part of antenatal care is getting information that will help you to make informed choices</strong> about your pregnancy such as:</span><br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>You will receive a visit from the Midwife and the Health Visitor</strong><br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            The team midwife will visit the first day you are at home. This is to plan your individual postnatal care and may last up to an hour.<br />
                            <br />
                            If you and your baby are well and are happy with everything a<strong> midwife or a midwifery support worker (MSW) will come again five to eight days after the birth of your baby.</strong> At this appointment,with your permission, the New Born Blood Spot Test (also known as the PKU) will be performed (see booklet &lsquo;Screening tests for your baby&rsquo; in your midwifery discharge envelope, for further explanation of this test).<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>From day 10 after the birth of your baby</strong>, if you and your baby are fit and well, we will discharge you from midwifery care and hand you over to the Health visitors. Most discharge visits take place in your local <strong>Children&rsquo;s Centre</strong> (a full list of postnatal clinics are included in your discharge envelope), where you have a timed appointment and do not have to wait at home all day for a visit from the midwife. If you are unable to attend a Children&rsquo;s Centre or other venue (see additional page for full list of postnatal clinics), alternative arrangements will be made to see you at home.<br />
                            <br />
                            The timeline for forthcoming appointments is as follows:<br />
                            <br />
                            -1st week (PKU, birth registration, benefits)<br />
                            -2nd week (Hearing test, New birth visit)<br />
                            -1 month (BCG vaccination, book appointment with the GP for baby and mother&rsquo;s check)<br />
                            -2 months (1st immunisation, developmental check with the GP)<br />
                            <br />
                            Owing to the unpredictable nature of our work, our<strong> workloads and schedules can vary greatly day to day.</strong> Sometimes at short notice we may have to ring you to rearrange your visit for another time.

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>After your baby is born, your Health Visitor is a key contact for any worries or concerns you may have. </strong>
                            They will usually visit you in your home in the days following the birth and will update your<strong> &#39;red book&#39; 
                    (the key record of your baby&#39;s early health and development)</strong> with important information about your baby&#39;s weight gain and general health.
                    They will also<strong> advise on mum&#39;s wellbeing </strong>too, so if there is anything that&#39;s worrying you, from post C-section healing to your mental state of mind, 
                    <strong>don&#39;t hesitate to share your concerns</strong> with them. Their role extends to supporting the health and well being of the whole family though, so if you need 
                    support with your partner or other family members then they can help you too.

                            Following on from home visits you&#39;ll be encouraged to <strong>remain in contact with your health visiting team at a weighing-in clinic,</strong>

                            where your baby is weighed and you&#39;ll have the opportunity to <strong>talk to a Health Visitor about any concerns about your child&#39;s development, 
                       from breastfeeding issues to starting weaning. </strong>Clinics like these are usually held at a set time each week, and may take place at your doctor&#39;s surgery, 
                        community health clinic or another local centre, such as a church hall or Sure Start Centre.</span><br />

Ask the nurse to explain what everything is for and to show you how you can be involved in your baby&#39;s care. Once your baby is stable, you will be able to hold him or her. The nurses will show you how to do this and your baby will benefit greatly from physical contact with you.<br />

You may be asked to express some of your breast milk, which can be given to your baby through a tube. </strong>A fine tube is passed through his or her nose or mouth into the stomach. This won&#39;t hurt them.<br />
                                            Breast milk has particular benefits, especially for sick or premature babies, as it is enriched with proteins (notably antibodies), fats and minerals. <strong>If your baby is unable to have your breast milk to begin with, it can be frozen and given to them when they are ready. </strong>When you go home, you can express milk for the nurses to give while you are away. There is no need to worry about the quantity or quality of your milk. Some mothers find that providing breast milk makes them feel that they are doing something positive for their baby.<br />

                                        In many ways, caring for your premature baby at home may not be so different from how you had imagined life with a new baby. 
                                    You will have plenty of time to cuddle and play with him and watch him respond to everyday things he won&#39;t have experienced in the baby unit -

                                needs extra care - for example for breathing difficulties - you may feel very let down by general parenting books and websites, as they may not reflect your 
                                experience. However, they may still offer helpful advice with tips about feeding, sleeping routines and other aspects of life with a baby.<br />

                                    <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Adults can regulate their own temperature by sweating or shivering, but babies are not yet able to do this. </strong>
                                        You need to make sure that you keep your baby at a temperature that is comfortable and safe. The best way to do this is usually with layers - 
                                for example, a vest, a sleepsuit and blankets or a zip-up sleeping bag as necessary. You can easily add or remove an item depending on how warm or chilly the 
                                surroundings are.<br />
                                        &nbsp;<br />
                                        <strong>If you&#39;re not sure how much you need to wrap your baby up, ask a member of the Health Visiting team.</strong> He may get cold very quickly - 
                                 especially if left undressed, for example after having a bath - but high temperatures have been linked with cot death (see sudden infant death syndrome below),
                                 so it&#39;s equally important not to overload his cot with blankets.</span><br />

                                    weren&#39;t there!</strong> You can help your baby develop good &#39;sleep hygiene&#39; by doing things such as providing a <strong>quiet, dimly lit 
                                    environment at night time.</strong> In the early months, however, there&#39;s only so much that you can do, because babies get hungry. 
                                    Also, the smaller the baby, the more often they need to feed. Developing a good night&#39;s sleep for you and the rest of your family may be a long-term project.<br />

                                        <strong>Top and tail:</strong> When you wash your baby, use only water. You don&#39;t need to give him a bath every day, it is usually enough just to &#39;top and tail&#39; &ndash; using cotton-wool balls soaked with tepid water to wash his bottom, face and neck.<br />
                                        &nbsp;<br />
                                        <strong>Snuggle him dry:</strong> When your baby&#39;s skin is wet he will become cold very easily.

                        <h3>Newborn babies with jaundice</h3>
                        <p>
                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">Jaundice in newborn babies is common because their livers are immature. Severely jaundiced babies may be treated with phototherapy (light therapy). The baby is undressed and put under a very bright light, usually with a soft mask over their eyes. The special light helps to break down the chemical that causes jaundice. It may be possible for your baby to have phototherapy by your bed so that you don&#39;t have to be separated.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                This treatment may continue for several days, with breaks for feeds, before the jaundice clears up. In some cases, if the jaundice gets worse, an exchange transfusion of blood may be needed (some of your baby&#39;s blood will be removed and replaced with blood from a donor). This is not common. Some babies have jaundice because of liver disease and need different treatment. A blood test that checks for liver disease is done before phototherapy is started.<br />

                                <br />
                                Many babies are jaundiced for up to two weeks following birth. Jaundice can last up to three weeks in premature babies. It is more common in breastfed babies and does no harm. <u>It is not a reason to stop breastfeeding.</u><br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                It is important to see your doctor if your baby is still jaundiced after two weeks. You should see the doctor within a day or two. This is particularly important if your baby&#39;s poo is chalky white. A blood test will distinguish between &#39;breast milk jaundice&#39;, which will go away by itself, or jaundice that may need urgent treatment.&nbsp;</span>

                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">If your baby is disabled in some way, you will be coping with a lot of different feelings. You will also need to cope with the feelings of others, such as the baby&#39;s father, your relations and friends as they come to terms with the fact that your baby has a disability.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                More than anything else at this time, you will need to talk to people about how you feel, as well as about your baby&#39;s health and future.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                Your GP, a neonatologist (doctor for newborn babies), paediatrician (children&#39;s doctor) or your health visitor can all help you. You can also contact the hospital Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) or your social services department for information about local organisations that may be able to help. You can contact your social services department through your local authority.<br />

                        <strong><font size="3">Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death</font></strong>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">This is a syndrome in which apparently healthy babies die in their sleep, usually during the first six months of life. Premature babies are at higher risk for slightly longer than term babies. It&#39;s still not known exactly what causes SIDS, but we do know a number of things that help reduce it. Since the following guidelines were put in place in 1991, the number of cot deaths has reduced drastically.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Tips for reducing cot death</strong></span><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Lie your baby on his back, unless your Health Visiting team has advised otherwise, with his feet at the bottom of the cot.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Use lightweight blankets - never duvets or pillows, Keep bedding away from your baby&#39;s face, and tuck it in firmly.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Make sure no one smokes in the house.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Keep your baby in your room for the first six months, in his own cot.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Never fall asleep with your baby on the sofa or in your bed, especially if you&#39;re very tired or have been using alcohol, drugs or medication, or if your baby was premature or small at birth.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Make sure your baby rests well away from radiators or heaters and out of direct sunlight.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Keep the room at 16-20oC (61-68oC), but ideally at 18oC (64oF).</span></li>

                                        Food is one of life&rsquo;s greatest pleasures. Yet it&rsquo;s also a <strong>source of worry for many parents. What should my baby or child be eating?</strong> How do I encourage them to eat lots of different foods that will help to keep them healthy? Can I afford to feed them the right things?<br />

                                        <strong>For the first six months, babies only need breastmilk (or infant formula milk).</strong></span><br />

                                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">It&rsquo;s normal for babies aged three to five months to start waking up in the night. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they are hungry. At this age, their digestive system is still developing and they are probably not ready for solid food.</span></li>

                                            <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>By about six months, most babies are ready to start on solid food.</strong> At this age they may be able to sit up, wanting to chew and putting toys and other objects in their mouths, and reaching and grabbing for things.</span></li>
                                        <li>
                                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">Introducing a <strong>good variety of healthy foods</strong> from the start will help lay the foundations for healthy growth and development.</span></li>

                                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Breast or formula milk no longer provides all the nutrients required for a growing infant.</span></li>

It is important that a wide range of tastes are introduced and repeatedly reintroduced from the outset. This is because infants will accept different flavours at this age but are more suspicious of unfamiliar tastes as they get older</span></li>
                                            <li>
                                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Key developmental stages may be missed. At 6 months babies can be actively spoon fed with the upper lip moving down to clean the spoon. By nine months they are able to control their tongue to enhance swallowing of mixed texture foods and by twelve months they are able to swallow with closed lips. During this time the infant becomes more adept at picking up and moving things towards the mouth and therefore will be developing self feeding and be able to take finger food</span></li>

                                            <strong>Nuts.</strong> Whole nuts, including peanuts, should not be given to children under five years in case they choke. As long as there is no history of food or other allergies in your family, you can give your baby peanuts, as long as they are crushed or ground into peanut butter. See pages 15 and 58 for information about peanut allergies.<br />

                                            <strong>Low-fat foods</strong>. Fat is an important source of calories and some vitamins for babies and young children. It&rsquo;s better for babies and young children under two to have full-fat milk, yoghurt and cheese rather than low-fat kinds of milk, yoghurt, fromage frais, cheese or spreads.<br />

                                            <strong>Raw shellfish</strong>. Raw shellfish can increase the risk of food poisoning so it&rsquo;s best not to give this to babies.<br />

                                            <strong>Eggs.</strong> Eggs can be given to babies over six months, but make sure they are thoroughly cooked until both the white and the yolk are solid.<br />

                                            <strong>The principles of weaning outlined in previous sections apply to babies being weaned onto a vegetarian diet.</strong> Due to the<strong> high nutrient requirements for growth</strong> and development and the more bulky nature of vegetarian/vegan diets and the relatively small capacity of an infant&lsquo;s stomach, a little<strong> extra care may be required</strong> to ensure the child gets all the nutrients it needs from food The foods which a vegetarian is prepared to eat do vary so <strong>parents should be consulted to check which foods they are willing to let their child eat.</strong> Meat, poultry and fish are sources of protein, iron and B vitamins. All varieties of beans, lentils, cheese and eggs are suitable substitutes and should be included daily where appropriate according to the type of vegetarian diet. High iron foods should be offered at each meal for example:</span><br />
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">fortified breakfast cereal, oats, or egg at breakfast</span></li>
                                            <li>
                                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">eggs/pulses along with green vegetables at the other 2 main meals</span></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Fruits and vegetables should be included as often as possible, as the vitamin C can help absorb iron.</strong><br />

                                            Suitable Foods For Vegetarian Weaning 6 &ndash; 9 months Cheese, tofu (soya curd) Pulses - Mashed peas, beans, lentils, Dahl Smooth peanut butter* Rice and wheat based cereals, breakfast cereals, e.g. weetabix, and porridge made from oats bread, 9 &ndash; 12 months Include beans, lentils and cheese at 2 meals each day. Weaning from 17 weeks Infants on vegetarian diets should also be weaned at six months/26 weeks but when parents choose to start earlier suggestions for weaning include: Pureed potato Carrot Cauliflower Spinach Baby rice, thin porridge made from rice, cornmeal. Vegetable and fruit purees Mashed lentils Pureed beans (add small amount of oil to soften beans) A wide variety of fruits and vegetables: e.g. bananas, cabbage, broccoli, swede. Pureed apple and pear. Sago or millet<br />

                                            <strong>Vegan Weaning </strong>

                                            A nutritionally adequate vegan diet can be achieved through a careful combination of nuts, pulses and cereals. A great deal of consideration and planning of meals is required to wean an infant onto a vegan diet. Children being weaned on to a vegan diet will require supplements of vitamin B12 and riboflavin. Where there are doubts about the adequacy of intakes, the child should be referred to a Registered Dietitian for dietary assessment and advice. The Department of Health advice for vegan weaning is: Vegan diets are not recommended for young babies as they do not supply enough energy and nutrients. Talk to a dietitian first.<br />

The sugars contained in them can cause decay where teeth have erupted<br />

                                <strong>Why do babies and children under 5 years need supplements? </strong>
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Even on a healthy balanced diet babies and children under 5 years have such high requirements for vitamins A, C and D that<strong> many of them do not get enough of them from food. </strong>These vitamins are<strong> important for the immune system</strong> and vitamin D is essential for good bone health and preventing rickets.<br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>The babies and children most at risk of not getting enough vitamin D are those with dark skins from Asian, African and Middle Eastern families who are living in northern European countries such as the UK.</strong> They need more sunshine to make vitamin D on their skin than white babies and children. Vitamin D is only made in skin in the UK during the summer months, April to September and it is the main source of vitamin D as there is very little in food. <strong>Only oily fish such as sardines, kippers, salmon, pilchards and trout are good sources of vitamin D. Meat and eggs contain a little vitamin D.</strong><br />
                                <br />
                                Other foods contain negligible amounts, except margarine which is fortified with it. <strong>Healthy Start is a tool for health professionals to help identify pregnant women and families who may need extra help and support to breastfeed and to have a healthier lifestyle. </strong>Health professionals should advise parents where they can obtain Healthy Start vitamins locally. As part of the Healthy Start voucher scheme the health professional&lsquo;s role is to give appropriate health and lifestyle advice about diet in pregnancy, infant feeding, weaning and the benefits of milk, fresh fruit and vegetables and vitamin supplementation.<br />

                        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">In every culture, weaning aims to <strong>accustom babies to the staple diet,</strong> while relying on milk as the main source of nutrition. In countries where food is in short supply, mothers may breast-feed for up to two years. <strong>Weaning foods are universally bland and of high carbohydrate composition.</strong> In many cases, recipes for traditional weaning foods have been passed down through generations.<br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>In Asian countries</strong>, rice is the basis of kedgeree or kongi, which is fed to babies from five months of age. Initially, boiled, sieved rice is added to cooked lentil juice.<br />
                                <br />
                                As babies mature, pureed lentil is added to rice; followed by peas, carrots, tomato pulp, dill, coriander and sometimes yoghurt.<br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>In the Caribbean</strong>, first foods are often steamed. For example, steamed white fish and pumpkin are pureed with cho-cho, a local vegetable.<br />
                                Parents also offer their babies&#39; pureed chicken casserole or fish.<br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>In Africa</strong>, maize porridge or rice forms the first food, to which vegetable and protein-rich foods are gradually added.<br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>In Mexico and much of South America</strong>, first foods are based on potatoes, corn, peppers, beans and tortillas.<br />

                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Breast milk or infant formula should be continued until 1 year of age.</span></li>

                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Small quantities of whole cow&#39;s milk may be used to mix solid foods, in milk puddings, custards, sauces and yoghurts from six months of age.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Whole cow&#39;s milk should not be used as a main drink until after 1 year of age. It contains little vitamin D and iron and has been shown to cause sub-clinical gastrointestinal bleeding in some children.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Low fat, skimmed milk and dried milks, evaporated and condensed milk are unsuitable as infant feeds. Use of low fat milks is not recommended until the child is older and is eating well on a varied diet and is growing well.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Semi-skimmed milk may be given to healthy children over 2 years who are eating a good variety of foods and when it is already in general use within the home.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Skimmed milk should not be given to children under 5 years because of its low energy and vitamin A and D content.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">When a child starts on cows&lsquo; milk as the main drink, attention should be paid to the amount of iron in the child&lsquo;s diet and vitamin supplements given if there is any doubt about the nutritional adequacy of the diet. Unpasteurised milk is not recommended for children under 2 years of age. If a parent or carer insists on using it, then it must be boiled before use.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Soya drinks - These drinks&lsquo; which may be referred to as ?soya milk, are not infant formulae, should not be used during weaning. If used after one year of age particular attention should be given to ensure adequate nutrient intakes, especially calcium and energy intakes. Particular care should be taken to safeguard dental health owing to the high sugar content of some soya drinks. Unsweetened varieties are available.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Other milks e.g. goats, sheep, processed and powdered milk. &nbsp;These milks are totally unsuitable for infants under 1 year of age because they have a very high protein and salt content. They are also deficient in vitamins A, D, C, B12, folate and iron and are not always pasteurised.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Claims that these milks are less allergenic than cow&lsquo;s milk have not been substantiated. Goats&lsquo; milk protein and lactose content is similar to that in cows&lsquo; milk and therefore makes it unsuitable for the treatment of either cows&lsquo; milk protein or lactose intolerance</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Goat and sheep&#39;s milk may be given from the age of one year so long as precautions against mineral and vitamin deficiencies are taken, the milk must be pasteurised or boiled.</span></li>

                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Infant formulae and follow-on milks made from goat&#39;s milk are not approved for use within Europe.</span></li>

                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Other milks such as buffalo, mare&lsquo;s milk, processed milk such as condensed and evaporated milk, non-infant powdered milks and plant milks are all nutritionally unacceptable for infant feeding and should not be used.&nbsp;</span></li>

                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">In very hot weather additional fluids may be required for bottle fed babies. Cooled boiled water is the preferred drink for formula fed babies.</span></li>

                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">Fruit juices such as orange juice should be discouraged before 6 months. This is because though they are a good source of Vitamin C, if given they can reduce the intake of milk. They are naturally sweet and can cause tooth decay even if the baby&lsquo;s teeth are barely through yet. Water is a better option.</span></li>
                         <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                             <span style="font-size: 16px;">For babies on a vegetarian diet or being breast fed, giving dilute fruit juice (1 part juice to 10 parts water) at meal times only in a feeder cup can be a good idea since Vitamin C helps absorb iron as part of a weaning diet.

                             The following drinks are not suitable for babies as they can fill them up and replace more nutritious foods and some contribute to tooth decay due to the sugar or acid content. Use of the following should be avoided or discouraged but if given it should only be at mealtime.</span><br />

                             The Department of Health advises that all toddlers and young children should avoid the consumption of rice drinks in order to minimise their exposure to inorganic arsenic. This follows research published by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) looking at levels of arsenic in rice drinks.&nbsp;<br />

                                    Expect to find a greenish-black, tarry, sticky poop that looks like motor oil in your newborn&#39;s nappy. Since meconium is made of amniotic fluid, mucus, 
                                skin cells, and other stuff ingested in utero, it doesn&#39;t really smell &ndash; so you may not realize it&#39;s time for a nappy change.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    When your baby is 2 to 4 days old, his poop will become lighter in color &ndash; sort of an army green &ndash; and less sticky. 
                            This so-called transitional stool is a sign that he&#39;s started digesting early breast milk or formula and that his intestinal tract is okay.</span><br />

                                    If your baby is exclusively breastfed, her poop will be yellow or slightly green and have a mushy or creamy consistency. It may be runny enough to resemble diarrhea. 
                            Breastfed poop typically looks like Dijon mustard and cottage cheese mixed together and may be dotted with little seed-like flecks. 
                            Interestingly, its smell is not to bad.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    There are many shades of normal when it comes to breastfed poop. One you might see is a greener hue, which could signify that you ate something different 
                            than you normally do. If your baby isn&#39;t experiencing any other symptoms, there&#39;s no need to worry.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    If you see bright green and frothy poop in your baby&#39;s nappy, almost like algae, she&#39;s probably getting too much foremilk &ndash; the low-calorie milk that 
                            comes first in a feeding &ndash; and not enough hindmilk, the higher-fat, super-nutritious stuff. It could mean that you&#39;re not feeding her long enough

                            It&#39;s more pungent than poop from breastfed babies and a little less pungent than poop from babies who are eating solid food, 
                            but you&#39;ll recognize the smell.<br />

                                    Solid-food poop tends to be brown or dark brown and thicker than peanut butter, but still mushy. It&#39;s also smellier.</span><br />

                                    Occasionally your baby&#39;s poop will have identifiable chunks of food in it or be tinged with a surprising hue of the rainbow, like red, orange, or dark blue. 
                            Red could mean beets, orange suggests carrots, and dark blue implies blueberries (you may see pieces of blueberry skin in there, too).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Not to worry! You&#39;re probably seeing this because certain foods are only partially digestible or travel so quickly through the intestines that they don&#39;t have 
                            time to completely break down. It also happens when your baby eats a lot of one type of food or doesn&#39;t chew a mouthful completely before he swallows.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The time to call the doctor is if your baby&#39;s poop consistently has undigested food in it. The doctor will check to make sure your baby&#39;s intestines are 
                            absorbing food and nutrients properly.</span><br />

                                    is very runny and appears to be made up of water more than solids. It can be yellow, green, or brown and can seep or &quot;explode&quot; out of the nappy.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Diarrhea can be a sign of an infection or allergy, and if it lasts for a while without being treated, can lead to dehydration. Call the doctor if your baby is 3 months
                            old or younger, has more than two or three diarrhea-filled nappies, or continues having diarrhea for more than a day or two.<br />

                                    It&#39;s also wise to call the doctor if your baby&#39;s diarrhea contains visible blood or mucus.</span><br />

                            <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_constipation_79.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">constipated</a>. 
                            Your baby may be visibly uncomfortable when she&#39;s pooping, and the poop may even be tinged with blood from irritating the anus on the way out.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    One or two pebbly nappies isn&#39;t a concern, but if your baby has three or more (or if you see blood), it&#39;s best to call the doctor. Constipation often happens 
                            in babies who are being introduced to solid foods, or it can be a sign of milk or soy protein sensitivity or a lack of tolerance to something in breast milk or 
                            formula. Your doctor may recommend giving your baby water, pear juice, or prune juice to help move things along.</span><br />

                                    Does your baby&#39;s nappy look like it&#39;s been slimed? Greenish poop streaked with shiny, glistening strings means there&#39;s mucus in it. 
                            This sometimes happens when a baby is especially drooly, since mucus in saliva often goes undigested.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    But mucus in poop is also a telltale sign of an infection or allergy. If it&#39;s accompanied by any other symptoms or shows up in your baby&#39;s nappy for 
                            two days or more, call the doctor to rule out any problems.</span><br />

                                    Sometimes the blood in a baby&#39;s poop is bright red, and sometimes it&#39;s black (which means it&#39;s been digested).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Bright red blood can show up in baby poop for a few different reasons. Call your doctor if you notice:</span><br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Normal poop tinged with red blood, which is often a sign of a milk protein allergy.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Constipated poop with a hint of red blood, likely a result of tears in the anus or tiny hemorrhoids.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Diarrhea mixed with red blood, which can indicate a bacterial infection.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">When black blood appears in a baby&#39;s nappy &ndash; usually in little flecks that look like black poppy or sesame seeds &ndash; it&#39;s often because the baby is breastfed and swallowing blood from Mom&#39;s cracked and bleeding nipples. While this is a sign that you need some pain relief, it doesn&#39;t pose a threat to your baby. Still, you should call the doctor to make sure it&#39;s not something more serious, like bleeding from your baby&#39;s intestines<br />

                                    <strong>A newborn can have as many as eight to ten bowel movements a day</strong>, but as long as she is having at least one, she&#39;s probably all right.<br />
                                    One day without a bowel movement is usually no cause for concern.<strong> As long as your baby is feeding well and wetting her nappy five or six times a day, then she&#39;s most likely getting enough to eat.

                                    In the early days, a newborn&#39;s bowel movements are thick and dark green in color. This is due to a substance called meconium that has been building up in her intestines during pregnancy. As the baby starts to feed and have bowel movements, she will finish expelling the meconium and her stools will start to turn yellowish. <strong>It is not uncommon for an infant&#39;s bowel movements to vary in color from day to day. </strong>The color of the stools can depend on a variety of things, including what a breastfeeding mom is eating, how hydrated the baby is, and the type and frequency of formula the infant is being fed, if applicable.<br />

                                    What goes in must come out, so just about <strong>every feeding in the early weeks following birth should produce a bowel movement.</strong> The number and</span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/404_whats-the-normal-color-of-a-breastfed-babys-bowel-movement_8830.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');"><span style="color: #0000ff;">type</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> of movements your baby has will indicate whether he&#39;s getting enough to eat.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        During the meconium phase (the first few days after birth), your baby may have four or five tarry, dark, greenish-black stools spread out over two or three days. <strong>As your colostrum develops into mature milk, he should have at least two to five bowel movements in a 24-hour period</strong> for the first six weeks. He may even have had a bowel movement every time you change his nappy throughout the day.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        After six weeks, it&#39;s normal for some babies to have fewer bowel movements, though others may continue having frequent ones. Don&#39;t be alarmed if your baby has a bowel movement only once a week. <strong>He&#39;s not constipated unless his stools are hard and dry.</strong> If your baby&#39;s producing loose, unformed stools with a pea soup consistency and cottage cheese-like curds, he&#39;s getting a good balance of foremilk and hindmilk. Don&#39;t be concerned if his nappies overflow!<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Once your exclusively breastfed baby begins eating solids (between 6 and 8 months of age), his stools will get firmer and have a stronger odour.<br />

                                        <strong>Is it normal for my baby to poop after every feeding? </strong>
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Yes. &quot;Some babies will poop after every feeding and some every three days. It&#39;s all normal,&quot; says <strong>peadiatrician Tanya Remer Altmann</strong>, editor of The Wonder Years: Helping Your Baby and Young Child Successfully Negotiate the Major Developmental Milestones.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>Pooping after every feeding is especially common in breastfeeding newborns, </strong>says Altmann. If a breastfed baby has a bowel movement after nearly every feeding during the first few weeks, it&#39;s actually a good sign &mdash; it means he&#39;s getting plenty of milk.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Bowel movements can slow down between 3 and 6 weeks, but Altmann says some babies will continue with their poop-after-every-feeding pattern. <strong>&quot;Some 1-year-olds still poop five times a day,&quot;</strong> she says.Formula-fed babies often have bowel movements less frequently than breastfed ones. But it&#39;s normal for them to poop after every feeding as well.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Generally, if your baby&#39;s bowel movements are fairly consistent and he&#39;s acting like his usual self,<strong> frequent poops aren&#39;t a cause for concern.</strong> However, if there&#39;s a sudden change in your baby&#39;s pooping pattern and his stool becomes more watery, check with his doctor. This could be a sign of infection.<br />

                                        Babies who have frequent bowel movements can be more prone to </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_diaper-rash_81.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');"><span style="color: #0000ff;">nappy rash</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. You may want to <strong>coat his bottom with a barrier cream as a precaution,</strong> says Altmann.

                                                It&#39;s normal for newborns to pass frequent watery stools.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Newborn intestines do not absorb food very well, and much of it is excreted into the stool. After the first few months, absorption improves, resulting in thicker, less frequent stools. But as long as your infant is alert, wakens to feed, and is wetting nappies frequently, then she/he is probably getting enough fluid from her feeding and not losing too much in her bowel movements.<br />

                                                An <strong>occasional spot of blood in a newborn&#39;s nappy&nbsp; is nothing to be alarmed about.</strong> There are many possible causes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Your baby may have swallowed<strong> blood from a cracked nipple during breastfeeding.</strong> (The crack may not be obvious and it may take some searching to find it.) This will not hurt the baby and you may continue to breastfeed as your nipple heals.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The blood may be from a <strong>scratch or crack in the skin of your baby&#39;s rectum if she/he has had dry, hard, or large bowel movements,</strong> but this is rarely a problem for newborns since they have not yet started on solid foods and are unlikely to be constipated. You can <strong>help it heal by applying antibacterial ointment or moisturizer to the irritation if it is on the outside skin.</strong> A female infant may have a little bloody vaginal discharge in her nappy&nbsp; due to the withdrawal of maternal hormones after delivery.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                This usually stops as the hormones return to normal levels. A male infant may be bleeding a little from a healing circumcision. Finally, <strong>nappy rash can lead to some bleeding if it gets severe enough</strong>. Blood in the nappy is a problem only<strong> if the bleeding becomes heavy or persistent, or if your baby appears ill, has a high fever, or bruises easily. If you do notice any blood in your baby&#39;s nappy, make sure you mention it to your Health Visitor or the GP to be on the safe side.&nbsp;</strong><br />

                                                As infants move from a liquid to a predominantly solid diet their <strong>stools can become harder and uncomfortable to pass.</strong> This change is even more dramatic if your baby has become accustomed to the natural laxative effect of breast milk.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                <strong>A few foods are commonly associated with constipation. Bananas are near the top of the list </strong>&mdash; an unfortunate fact because they are a very nourishing fruit and most children like them. <strong>Cheese is famous for causing hard bowel movements,</strong> and it, too, is often popular with children of all ages. <strong>Cow&#39;s milk can also cause constipation,</strong> which is why it&#39;s unwise to give it to your child until he can take it from a cup. A child is more likely to drink an excessive amount &mdash; and wind up with bowel problems &mdash; if he uses a bottle.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Soy-based formulas also tend to be constipating. If you suspect that soy is the culprit in your child&#39;s problem, <strong>consult your pediatrician for alternative sources of liquid nutrition.</strong><br />
                                                <br />
                                                In general, juices, fruits (but not bananas), fresh vegetables, and water are associated with looser stools. Keep in mind that we all have slightly different <strong>gastrointestinal systems. That means that one child can follow a certain diet and have normal bowel movements, while another child may eat exactly the same foods and be constipated.</strong> Experiment to find a diet that suits your child&#39;s nutritional needs and allows him to have comfortable bowel movements<br />

                                                Parents spend a lot of time wondering and worrying about whether their infant&#39;s bowel movements are<strong> &quot;normal.&quot; In fact, there&#39;s really no such thing. Babies&#39; bowel habits are as individual as they are, and over time you&#39;ll get to know your baby&#39;s routine.</strong><br />
                                                <br />
                                                That said, there is a typical pattern to look for in any baby&#39;s bowel habits. <strong>During the first few days of life, your baby will pass meconium, the thick, black or dark green substance that was in his intestines before he was born</strong>. Once the meconium has passed, the bowel movements of a formula-fed baby are typically yellow, tan, brown, or green. As long as there isn&#39;t blood in the stool, any colour is normal.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                <strong>A formula-fed baby&#39;s stool is a little bit firmer than a breastfed baby&#39;s,</strong> about the consistency of peanut butter. If it&#39;s much harder than that, it may be a sign of </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_constipation_79.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');"><span style="color: #0000ff;">constipation</span></a><span style="color: #0000ff;">,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and you should tell your Health Visitor.<strong> If you&#39;re worried about constipation and your baby is younger than 4 months old, don&#39;t feed him anything other than formula or breast milk without checking with your Health Visitor or GP first. </strong>You may inadvertently deprive your baby of essential nutrients if you feed him a diarralyte , water, or juice. Babies over 4 months can have a few ounces of water a day, but if you think he&#39;s constipated, you should talk with your Health Visitor about how best to solve the problem.<br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    Another thing to keep in mind is that <strong>around 1 to 2 months of age, many babies go from having several bowel movements a day to going several days between bowel movements. This, too, is perfectly normal.</strong> It&#39;s not how often a baby moves his bowels, but how hard the stool is once it&#39;s passed that&#39;s cause for concern. <strong>When you introduce cereal and other solids to your baby&#39;s diet, you can expect dramatic changes in the odour, colour, consistency, and frequency of his bowel movements depending on what he&#39;s eating.</strong>&nbsp;<br />

                                                    That depends on how old your baby is. In the first few days of life, your baby&#39;s stool should be dark green to black. This means your baby is passing meconium, a tarry substance made up of all her bowels have accumulated during nine months in the womb.</span><br />

                                            <br />
                                            <strong>Since meconium buildup can cause jaundice, it&#39;s important to breastfeed at least 10 to 12 times in 24 hours to clear it out of your baby&#39;s system. </strong>You should be concerned if your baby has meconium stools for longer than three days. If your baby sleeps a lot, you should pump and hand- or finger-feed the colostrum to your baby to get her digestive tract working properly.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            After the colostrum phase, your milk changes and bowel movements become brown in color, less sticky, and easier to wipe off the skin. As your milk becomes more plentiful, the stools finally transition from yellow-green to yellow.<strong> Nursing your baby frequently causes the stools to change color more quickly. Plus, the more you nurse, the quicker your milk changes from colostrum to mature milk. </strong>Once the stools turn yellow and have a seedy quality, they should stay that way as long as your baby is exclusively breastfed.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            When your baby has a bowel movement, <strong>look for stools that are loose in texture, with the consistency of pea soup. You may even notice small cottage cheese-type curds. The odour should be mild and not unpleasant</strong>. If you notice a succession of watery green stools, your baby <strong>may be consuming more foremilk than hindmilk.</strong> If you make sure she finishes nursing on the first breast before switching, she&#39;ll get more of the high-calorie hindmilk and produce a more yellowish stool as a result.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            <strong>A watery stool also could indicate a sensitivity to a certain food you&#39;re eating or medication you&#39;re taking. </strong>A good first step for determining whether that&#39;s the case is to eliminate all dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt from your diet for at least three weeks.<strong> If the bowel movements change, you&#39;ll know it was the dairy. Add dairy back slowly to your diet, starting with the hardest cheeses. If your baby&#39;s stools turn watery again, you&#39;ll have to find other sources of calcium and protein for your diet.&nbsp;</strong></span></span><br />

                                    <span style="font-size: 16px;">Eating healthy is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and is something that should be taught at a young age. The following are some general guidelines for helping your adolescent eat healthy. It is important to discuss your adolescent&#39;s diet with his or her health care provider before making any dietary changes or placing your adolescent on a diet. Discuss the following healthy eating recommendations with your adolescent to ensure he or she is following a healthy eating plan:</span>
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Eat three meals a day, with healthy snacks.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Increase fibre in the diet and decrease the use of salt.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Drink water. Try to avoid drinks that are high in sugar. Fruit juice can have a lot of calories, so limit your adolescent&#39;s intake. Whole fruit is always a better choice.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">When cooking for your adolescent, try to bake or broil instead of fry.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Make sure your adolescent watches (and decreases, if necessary) his or her sugar intake.</span></li>

                                        <br />
                                        The following food plate was prepared to guide parents in selecting foods for children age 2&nbsp;and older.<br />

                                        <br />
                                        The My Plate icon is divided into&nbsp;five food group categories, emphasizing the nutritional intake of the following:</span>
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Grains. </strong>Foods that are made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain are grain products. Examples include whole wheat, brown rice, and oatmeal.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Vegetables. </strong>Vary your vegetables. Choose a variety of vegetables, including dark green, red, and orange vegetables, legumes (peas and beans), and starchy vegetables.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Fruits. </strong>Any fruit or 100 percent fruit juice counts as part of the fruit group. Fruits may be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried, and may be whole, cut up, or pureed.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Dairy. </strong>Milk products and many foods made from milk are considered part of this food group. Focus on fat-free or low-fat products, as well as those that are high in calcium.</span></li>
                                    <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Protein. </strong>Go lean on protein. Choose low-fat or lean meats and poultry. Vary your protein routine&mdash;choose more fish, nuts, seeds, peas, and beans.</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                        <br />
                                        <strong>Exercise and everyday physical activity should also be included with a healthy dietary plan.</strong></span>

                                <h3>Healthy eating in adolescence</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Healthy eating during adolescence is important</strong> as body changes during this time affect an individual&#39;s nutritional and dietary needs. Adolescents are becoming more independent and <strong>making many food decisions on their own</strong>. Many adolescents experience a growth spurt and an<strong> increase in appetite and need healthy foods to meet their growth needs</strong>. Adolescents tend to eat more meals away from home than younger children. They are also heavily influenced by their peers. <strong>Meal convenience is important to many adolescents and they may be eating too much of the wrong types of food (for example, soft drinks, fast-food, or processed foods).</strong>
                                    <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/Feeding/Adolescents.png" style="width: 256px; height: 350px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;" /><br />
                                    <br />
                                    Further, a common concern of many adolescents is dieting<strong>. Girls may feel pressure from peers to be thin and to limit what they eat.</strong> Both boys and girls may diet to &quot;make weight&quot; for a particular sporting or social event.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>The following are some helpful considerations as you prepare meals for your adolescent:</strong></span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Arrange for teens to find out about nutrition for themselves by providing teen-oriented magazines or books with food articles and by <strong>encouraging them and supporting their interest in health, cooking, or nutrition.</strong></span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Take their suggestions, when possible, regarding foods to prepare at home.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Experiment with foods outside your own culture.</span></strong></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Have several nutritious snack foods readily available. Most often, <strong>teenagers will eat whatever is convenient.</strong></span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">If there are foods that you do not want your teens to eat, avoid bringing them into the home.</span></li>

                            <h3>Why do we immunise?</h3>
                            <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Making decisions about immunisation: Why do we immunise?</strong><br />
                                <br />
                                Childhood immunisation is available against a <strong>wide range of diseases.</strong>&nbsp;There are three reasons why we immunise children. First, immunisation<strong> prevents children from becoming ill with unpleasant and serious infectious diseases,</strong> which have a risk of complications and long-term side effects. Until these diseases are eradicated, every child that is not immunised is at risk of complications if they catch the actual infectious disease itself. Complications such as ear infections, pneumonia and in rare cases, measles encephalitis (a rare brain disease which can occur in one in 5,000 cases of actual measles) can occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/Immunisation/Needle.png" style="width: 80%; float: right;" /><br />
                                <br />
                                Second, we immunise to try and<strong> help protect all children </strong>in the population. The more people who are immunised, the less of the infectious disease there is around so the less chance there is of anyone catching it. When levels of immunisation against an infectious disease are really, really high - then something happens called &#39;herd immunity&#39; where the risk of the disease occurring is so low that even those who cannot be immunised are unlikely to be affected. When this happens it means that even children who have leukaemia or other forms of lowered resistance to infections who cannot be given live vaccines such as measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the polio vaccine - and also babies under the age of one who are too young to have the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine will also not be exposed to the disease.&nbsp;<br />
                                <br />
                                Third, we immunise to try and <strong>wipe out as many infectious diseases as we can everywhere in the world. </strong>Although improvements in living standards and cleaner water have been key factors in the decline of infectious diseases in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, it is quite clear that the<strong> immunisation programmes have made a significant impact in getting rid of infectious diseases</strong> as well.&nbsp; In the ten years before the measles vaccine was introduced in to the United Kingdom, there were around 380,000 cases a year of measles and 850 deaths (Bedford, Elliman, 2001). Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1988. In the ten years since then - between 1989 and 1998, there were four deaths associated with acute measles and 19 deaths resulting from complications from measles.<br />

                        <h3>The Healthy Child Programme</h3>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>The HCP is a public health programme for children, young people and families,&nbsp;</strong>which focuses on early intervention and prevention. It offers a programme of&nbsp;screening tests, immunisations, developmental reviews, <strong>information and guidance&nbsp;on parenting and healthy choices.</strong> Due to its universal reach the HCP aims to identify families who need additional support or are at risk of poor health outcomes.<br />
                            <br />
                            <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/HowMyBabyWillGrow/Parents_baby.png" style="width: 60%; float: right;" /><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>***ALL CHILDREN DEVELOP AT DIFFERENT AGES, THEREFORE THE TIMESCALES SHOWN ARE ONLY A GUIDE***</strong><br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            Your child&rsquo;s growth and development are kept track of through a<strong> partnership between you and your health professional.</strong> At each well-child visit the health visitor looks for developmental delays or problems and talks with you about any concerns you might have. This is called<strong> developmental monitoring (or surveillance).</strong> Any problems noticed during developmental monitoring should be followed-up with developmental screening.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            Children with special health care needs should have developmental monitoring and screening just like those without special needs. <strong>Monitoring healthy development means paying attention not only to symptoms related to the child&rsquo;s condition, but also to the child&rsquo;s physical, mental, social, and emotional well-being.</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>The milestones for children who are born prematurely will often be delayed by&nbsp;approximately the number of weeks they were&nbsp;early.</strong>&nbsp; Similarily, if your child has been diagnosed with an underlying condition their milestones may also be delayed,&nbsp;<strong>Well-child clinics allow the health visitor to have regular contact with children to keep track of?or monitor? your child&rsquo;s health and development through periodic developmental screening.</strong> Developmental screening is a short test to tell if a child is learning basic skills when he or she should, or if there are delays. Developmental screening can also be done by other professionals in health care, community, or school settings.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            The health visitor might ask you some questions or talk and play with the child during an examination to see how he or she plays, learns, speaks, behaves, and moves. A delay in any of these areas could be a sign of a problem.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>The HCP recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays and disabilities during regular well-child clinic visits at:</strong></span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">1 year</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">2-2 &frac12; years</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">5 years</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;<br />
                            Additional screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for developmental problems due to preterm birth, low birthweight, or other reasons.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Why It&rsquo;s Important</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            Many children with developmental delays are not being identified as early as possible. As a result, these children must wait to get the help they need to do well in social and educational settings (for example, in school).<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Early Intervention Services</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            Research shows that early intervention treatment services can <strong>greatly improve a child&rsquo;s development.</strong> Early intervention services help children from birth through 3 years of age (36 months) learn important skills. Services include therapy to help the child talk, walk, and interact with others.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">We all know <strong>playing is fun, but did you know it&rsquo;s also the most effective way for children&nbsp;to learn?</strong> Through play, children can practise all the skills they will need as they grow up.<br />

                            <strong>Playing with your child</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            To grow and develop, <strong>children need time and attention from someone who is happy to play with them.</strong> Gradually they will learn to entertain themselves for some of the time, but first they need to learn how to do that. It <strong>can be hard to find the time to play with your child, especially when you have plenty of other things you need to do.</strong> The answer to this can be finding ways of involving your child in what you are doing, even the chores!<strong> Children learn from everything they do and everything that is going on around them.</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            When you are washing up, you can <strong>let your child join in,</strong> for example by washing the saucepan lids; when you cook, you can show them what you are doing and talk to them as you are working. Getting them involved in the things you do will teach them about taking turns and being independent, and they will also learn by copying what you do.<br />
                            <br />
                            <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/HowMyBabyWillGrow/ReadingOnPotty.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;" /><br />
                            <br />
                            Sometimes, things need to happen at certain times, and it&rsquo;s important that your child learns this. But when you are together,<strong> try not to work to a strict timetable. </strong>Your child is unlikely to fit in with it and then you will both get frustrated. <strong>There is no rule that says the washing-up has to be done before you go to the playground, especially if the sun is shining and your child is bursting with energy. As far as you can, move things around to suit you and your child&rsquo;s mood.</strong><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>For some families, everything is not &lsquo;all right&rsquo;.</strong> Sometimes, that niggling worry turns out to be a more serious problem or disability. If this happens to you, <strong>you will need support as well as information about the problem and what it&rsquo;s likely to mean for you and your child. </strong>You are bound to have a lot of questions for your health visitor, GP and any specialists you are referred to. You may find it easier to make a list. See &lsquo;Some questions you might like to ask&rsquo; &nbsp;for suggestions.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>You may find it difficult to take in everything that is said to you at first, or even the second time around. </strong>You may also find that not all health professionals talk easily or well to parents.<strong> Go back and ask for the information again. If you can, get a friend or relative to come with you, or at least take a pen and paper so you can make some notes.</strong> In the end, the honest answer to your questions may be &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;or &lsquo;We are not sure&rsquo;, but that is better than no answer at all.<br />

                            Special educational needs If you are concerned that your child has special educational needs &ndash; that is, you think they might need extra help at school &ndash; talk to a health professional who already knows you and your child.<br />
                            <br />
                            You, or any of the professionals involved in caring for your child, can <strong>ask your local authority to carry out a statutory assessment of your child&rsquo;s needs.</strong> After this, the local authority will decide whether to issue a statement that describes your child&rsquo;s needs and the support needed to meet them. <strong>The Advisory Centre for Education (see page 157of the &ldquo;Birth to Five Book for contact details) offers advice on education and produces a handbook on special education.</strong><br />

                            Children&rsquo;s Centres are linked to maternity services, so <strong>they can start supporting you before your baby is even born.</strong> Children&rsquo;s Centres provide health and family support services,&nbsp;integrated early learning and childcare for children from birth to five. They also <strong>offer information and advice for parents on issues from effective parenting to training and employment opportunities, and some offer services aimed specifically at young parents.</strong><br />

                                    <strong>Articulation</strong><br />
                                    How speech sounds are made (e.g., children must learn how to produce the &quot;r&quot; sound in order to say &quot;rabbit&quot; instead of &quot;wabbit&quot;).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>Voice</strong><br />
                                    Use of the vocal folds and breathing to produce sound (e.g., the voice can be abused from overuse or misuse and can lead to hoarseness or loss of voice).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>Fluency</strong><br />
                                    The rhythm of speech (e.g., hesitations or stuttering can affect fluency).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/HowMyBabyWillGrow/BabywithBook.png" style="width: 60%;" /><br />

                                    Children&#39;s speech and language development follows a typical pattern (see How Does Your Child Hear and Talk for more information).

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">The development of <strong>communication skills begins in infancy</strong>, before the emergence of the first word. Any speech or language problem is likely to have a significant effect on the child&#39;s social and academic skills and behaviour. <strong>The earlier a child&#39;s speech and language problems are identified and treated, the less likely it is that problems will persist or get worse</strong>. Early speech and language intervention can help children be more successful with reading, writing, schoolwork, and interpersonal relationships.<br />

Find Mad Kitty Cat who bites her lip and says &quot;f-f-f-f&quot; or Vinnie Airplane who bites his lip, turns his voice motor on and says &quot;v-v-v-v.&quot; These sounds will be old friends when your child is introduced to phonics in preschool and kindergarten.</span></li>

Play with Peter Tugboat, who says &quot;p-p-p-p.&quot; <strong>Let your child feel the air of sounds as you make them.</strong> Blow bubbles and make the sound &quot;b-b-b-b.&quot; Feel the motor in your throat on this sound.

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Show your child that <strong>you are interested in what he or she says to you by repeating what he or she has said and expanding on it.</strong> For example, if your child says, &quot;pretty flower,&quot; you can respond by saying, &quot;Yes, that is a pretty flower.

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Let your child &nbsp;know that what she or he has to say is important to you by asking him or her to repeat things that you do not completely understand.</strong> For example, &quot;I know you want a block.

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Expand on your child&#39;s vocabulary.</strong> Introduce new vocabulary through reading books that have a simple sentence on each page.</span></li>
                                    <li style="clear: both;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Name objects and <strong>describe the picture on each page of the book. State synonyms for familiar words</strong> (e.g., mommy, woman, lady, grown-up, adult) and use this new vocabulary in sentences to help your child learn it in context.</span></li>
                                    <li style="clear: both;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Put objects into a bucket and have your child remove one object at a time, saying its name. You <strong>repeat what your child says and expand upon it: &quot;That is a comb. Sam combs his hair.&quot;</strong> Take the objects from the bucket and help your child group them into categories (e.g., clothes, food, drawing tools).</span></li>
                                    <li style="clear: both;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cut out pictures from old magazines <strong>and make a scrapbook of familiar things. Help your child glue the pictures into the scrapbook.</strong> Practice naming the pictures, using gestures and speech to show how you use the items.</span></li>

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Look at family photos and<strong> name the people. Use simple phrases/sentences to describe what is happening in the pictures </strong>(e.g., &quot;Sam swims in the pool&quot;).</span></li>

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Write simple appropriate phrases</strong> under the pictures. For example, &quot;I can swim,&quot; or &quot;Happy birthday to Daddy.&quot; Your child will begin to understand that reading is oral language in print.</span></li>
                                    <li style="clear: both;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Ask your child questions that require a choice, rather than simply a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer. </strong>For example, rather than asking, &quot;Do you want milk? Do you want water?&quot;, ask, &quot;Would you like a glass of milk or water?&quot; Be sure to wait for the answer, and reinforce successful communication: &quot;Thank you for telling mommy what you want. Mommy will get you a glass of milk.&quot;</span></li>

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Continue to sing songs, play finger games (&quot;Where is Thumbkin?&quot;), and tell nursery rhymes (&quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot;). These <strong>songs and games introduce your child to the rhythm and sounds of language.</strong></span></li>
                                    <li style="clear: both;">
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Strengthen your child&#39;s language comprehension skills by playing the yes-no game:</strong> &quot;Are you a boy?&quot; &quot;Is that a zebra?&quot; &quot;Is your name Joey?&quot;</span></li>

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Work on comprehension skills by asking your child questions. <strong>Have him or her try to fool you with his or her own questions</strong>.

                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Expand on social communication and storytelling skills by &quot;acting out&quot; typical scenarios</strong> (e.g., cooking food, going to sleep, or going to the doctor) with a dollhouse and its props. Do the same type of role-playing activity when playing dress-up. As always, ask your child to repeat what he or she has said if you do not understand it completely. This shows that what he or she says is important to you.</span></li>

Act out the stories,</strong> and put on puppet shows of the stories. Have your child draw a picture of a scene from the story, or of a favorite part. You can do the same thing with videos and television shows, as these also have plots. Ask &quot;wh&quot; questions (who, what, when, where, or why) and monitor his or her response.</span></li>

                                <h3>Learning Two Languages</h3>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Anyone can learn a new language. Some people find it easier than others, but all of us can do it. People who can use two languages are <strong>bilingual.</strong><br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Children can learn to be bilingual<strong>. They can learn two languages at home, at school, or in the community. </strong>Some children learn both languages very well. But sometimes they know one language better than the other. <strong>The language a child knows better is called the dominant language.</strong> Over time the dominant language may change, especially if a child doesn&#39;t use it regularly.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Speaking two languages is like any other skill<strong>. To do it well, children need lots of practice, which parents can help provide.</strong> Without practice, it may be difficult for children to understand or talk to people in both languages.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>How do I teach my child to be bilingual? </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    There are a number of ways to teach children to speak more than one language. You can do the following:<br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Use two languages from the start. <strong>Many children grow up learning two languages</strong> at the same time.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Use only one language at home.</strong> Your child can learn the second language when he or she starts school.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Give your child many opportunities to hear and practice using both languages</strong> in everyday situations.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Will learning two languages cause speech or language problems? </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>No.</strong> Children all over the world learn more than one language without developing speech or language problems. <strong>Bilingual children develop language skills just as other children do.</strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/HowMyBabyWillGrow/Speech_book.png" style="width: 100%;" /><br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>What should I expect when my child learns more than one language? </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    Every bilingual child is unique. <strong>Developing skills in two languages depends on the quality and amount of experience the child has using both languages. The following are some basic guidelines: </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    &nbsp;</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Like other children, most bilingual children speak their first words by the time they are 1 year old </strong>(e.g., &quot;mama&quot; or &quot;dada&quot;). By age 2, most bilingual children can use two-word phrases (e.g., &quot;my ball&quot; or &quot;no juice&quot;). These are the same language developmental milestones seen in children who learn only one language.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">From time to time<strong>, children may mix grammar rules, or they might use words from both languages in the same sentence.</strong> This is a normal part of bilingual language development.</span></li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>When a second language is introduced, some children may not talk much for a while.</strong> This &quot;silent period&quot; can sometimes last several months. Again, this is normal and will go away.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What resources can I use to help my child be bilingual? </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>Books.</strong> You can read to your child in both languages. You can find the books you need at bookstores, at libraries, and on the Internet.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>Audiotapes and CDs.</strong> Tapes and CDs in other languages can help too. Singing is a great way to introduce a second language to your child, and it can be lots of fun!<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>Videotapes and DVDs.</strong> Children&#39;s programs are available in many languages. These programs often teach children about numbers, letters, colors, and basic vocabulary.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>Language programs.</strong> Children can also learn to be bilingual at language camps or in bilingual education programs. These give children the chance to use two languages with other children. Some school offer programs to help children learn another language from an early age.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>If my child is having trouble communicating, should we use only one language? </strong>
                                    <br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    In this case, it&#39;s best to talk to your child in the language you&#39;re most comfortable with. This is true even if he or she uses a different language at school. But try not to make a sudden change in your child&#39;s routine. This can be stressful.<br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />
                                    <strong>Children who are having problems in both languages may need professional help</strong><br />
                                    &nbsp;<br />

                                &nbsp;<br />
                                You can get help for especially difficult behaviour, so don&rsquo;t feel you have to go on coping alone. Talk to your health visitor or GP. Sometimes, a bit of <strong>support and encouragement might be all you need.</strong> Some children may need to be referred to a specialist where they can get the help they need. Having a child whose behaviour is very difficult can put a huge strain on you. <strong>You might find that you need help yourself</strong>.&nbsp;<br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Most newborn babies spend more time sleeping.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Total daily sleep can vary from eight hours up to 16&ndash;18 hours.</span></li>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Babies will wake during the night because they need to be fed, too hot or too cold.&nbsp;</span></li>

                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Baby will need fewer night feeds and sleep for longer stretches. Sometimes &nbsp;around eight hours or even longer at night.</span></li>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">By four months, they could be spending around twice as long sleeping at night as they do during the day.&nbsp;</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Six to 12 months. </strong>At this age, night feeds should no longer be necessary, and some babies will sleep for up to 12 hours at a stretch at night. However, teething discomfort or hunger may wake some babies during the night.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>12 months. </strong>Babies will sleep for around 12&ndash;15 hours altogether.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Two years. </strong>Most two-year-olds will sleep for about 11&ndash;12 hours at night, with one or two naps in the day.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Three to four years. </strong>Most will need about 12 hours of sleep, but the amount can range from eight hours up to 14. Some young children will still need a nap during the day.<br />

                            <strong>Bed Time Routine </strong>
                            <br />
                            <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/Behaviour/Sleep1.png" style="width: 70%;" /><br />
                            Getting into a simple, <strong>soothing bedtime routine</strong> early can help avoid sleeping problems later on.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            A routine could consist of :-<br />
                            &nbsp;</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Having a bath,</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Changing into night clothes,</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Feeding and having a cuddle before being put to bed.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Your baby will learn how to fall asleep </strong>in their cot if you put them down when they are still awake rather than getting them to sleep by rocking or cuddling in your arms. If they get used to falling asleep in your arms, they may need nursing back to sleep if they wake up again.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>As your child gets older</strong>, you might find it helpful to keep to a similar bedtime routine. Too much excitement and stimulation just before bed can wake your child up again.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            An example of a routine could be:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">bath, then put on night clothes</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">supper or a milky drink</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">brush teeth</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">go to bed</span></li>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">goodnight kiss and cuddle.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                            <strong>COMMON SLEEP PROBLEMS</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            Lots of young children find it difficult to settle down to sleep &ndash; and wake up during the night.<br />
                            For some parents, this might not be a problem. If you are happy for your child to go to bed at the same time as you, that is fine. But if you or your child are <strong>suffering from lack of sleep</strong>, you may like to try some of the suggestions here.<br />
                            &nbsp;</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Think about what time you want your child to go to bed.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Close to the time that your child normally falls asleep, start a 20-minute &lsquo;winding down&rsquo; bedtime routine. Bring this forward by 5&ndash;10 minutes a week until you get to the bedtime you want.</span></li>

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Nightmares. </strong>Nightmares are quite common. They often begin between the ages of 18 months and three years. Nightmares are not usually a sign of emotional disturbance. They may happen if your child is anxious about something or has been frightened by a TV programme or story. After a nightmare, <strong>your child will need comfort and reassurance</strong>. If your&nbsp;child has a lot of nightmares and you don&rsquo;t know why, talk to your GP or health visitor.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Night terrors. </strong>These can start before the age of one, but are most common in three and four year- olds. Usually, the child will scream or start thrashing around while they are still asleep. Calm them down without waking them up, they will not remember anything in the morning.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Tackle it together with your partner. </strong>If you have a partner, you should agree between you<br />
                            how to tackle your child&rsquo;s sleeping problems, and it will be easier to stick to your plan.<br />

                            <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>It&rsquo;s perfectly normal for toddlers to refuse to eat&nbsp;or even taste new foods.</strong> Children will usually eat&nbsp;enough to keep themselves going, so try not to worry unless your child is not putting on weight&nbsp;as quickly as they should or is obviously ill.<br />
                                <br />
                                <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/Behaviour/FussyEating1.png" style="width: 300px; height: 247px; float: right; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" />As long as your child eats some food from each&nbsp;of the<strong> five food groups </strong>&ndash; even if it&rsquo;s always&nbsp;the same old favourites &ndash; you should not need to&nbsp;worry. Gradually introduce other food choices or&nbsp;go back to the foods&nbsp;your child did not like&nbsp;before and try them again. Remember, as long as&nbsp;your child is active and gaining weight, they&nbsp;are getting enough to eat, even if it doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;look like it to you.<br />
                                <br />
                                The best way for your child to learn to eat and&nbsp;enjoy new foods is to copy you, so try to eat&nbsp;with them as often as you can so that you&nbsp;can set a good example.<strong> Children are very quick&nbsp;to pick up o</strong></span><strong style="font-size: 16px;">n your own feelings about food.</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;Perhaps you are on a diet, or have a weight&nbsp;problem, or are just very keen to eat healthily.&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-size: 16px;">
                                    <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/Behaviour/FussyEating2.png" style="width: 90%; float: right;" /></strong>

                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">Your child may well be picking up on your anxiety&nbsp;and/or using mealtimes as a way to get attention.<br />

                        <ul>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Give your child the same food as the rest of the family, and eat your meals together if possible.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Give small portions and praise your child for eating, even if they only manage a little.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">If your child rejects the food, don&rsquo;t force-feed them. Just take the food away without comment. Try to stay calm even if it&rsquo;s very frustrating.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Don&rsquo;t leave meals until your child is too hungry or tired to eat.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Your child may be a slow eater so you may have to be patient.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Don&rsquo;t give too many between meal snacks. You could limit them to, for example, a milk drink and some fruit slices or a small cracker with a slice of cheese.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                            <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Children get bladder and bowel&nbsp;control when they are physically&nbsp;ready for it</strong>, and when they want&nbsp;to be dry and clean. Every child is&nbsp;different, so it&rsquo;s best not to compare&nbsp;your child with others.<br />
                                <br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Most children can control their bowels before their bladders.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">By the age of two, some children will be dry during the day; however, this is still quite early.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">By the age of three, nine out of 10 children are dry most days. Even then, all children have the odd accident, especially when they are excited or upset or absorbed in doing something else.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">By the age of four most children are reliably dry. It usually takes a little longer to learn to stay dry throughout the night. Although most children learn this between the ages of three and five, it is estimated that a quarter of three-year-olds and one in six five-year-olds wet their bed.</span></li>

                            <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>When to start&nbsp;potty training</strong><br />
                                <br />
                                It helps to remember that you really&nbsp;<strong>cannot force your child to use a&nbsp;potty. If they are not ready, </strong>you will&nbsp;not be able to make them.&nbsp;In the meantime, the best thing you can do is to&nbsp;encourage the behaviour you want.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                Most parents start thinking about&nbsp;potty training when their child is&nbsp;around 18&ndash;24 months, but there&nbsp;is no perfect time. It&rsquo;s probably<strong>&nbsp;easier to start in the summer,</strong> when&nbsp;washing dries better and there are&nbsp;fewer clothes to take off, and at a&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial;">time when you can have a clear run&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">at it, without any great disruptions&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">or changes to your child&rsquo;s or your&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">family&rsquo;s routine.</span></span>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">They know when they have a wet or dirty nappy.</span></span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">They get to know when they are passing urine, and may tell you they are doing it.</span></span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The gap between wetting is at least an hour (if it&rsquo;s less, potty training may fail and at the very least will be extremely hard work for you).</span></span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">They know when they need to wee, and may say so in advance. &nbsp;You will probably find that potty training is fastest if your child has started to show any of the above s</span>i<span style="color: #000000;">gns before you start. &nbsp;If you start earlier, be prepared for a lot of accidents as your child learns.&nbsp;</span></span></li>

It helps to let your child see you using the toilet and explain what you are doing.</span></span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>If your child regularly&nbsp;</strong><strong>opens their bowels at the&nbsp;</strong><strong>same time each day, try&nbsp;</strong><strong>leaving their nappy off and&nbsp;</strong><strong>suggesting that they go in&nbsp;</strong><strong>the potty. </strong>If your child is even&nbsp;the slightest bit upset by the&nbsp;idea, just put the nappy back&nbsp;on and leave it a few more&nbsp;weeks before trying again.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>As soon as you see that&nbsp;</strong><strong>your child knows when&nbsp;</strong><strong>they are going to wee,&nbsp;</strong><strong>encourage them to use their&nbsp;</strong><strong>potty. </strong>If your child slips up, just&nbsp;mop it up and wait for next&nbsp;time.

                        <h3>Temper Tantrums</h3>
                        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">Tempers and tantrums <strong>can start at around 18 months.</strong> They are very common at around this age: one in five two-year-olds has a temper tantrum every day. One reason for this is that two-year-olds <strong>really want to express themselves, </strong>but find it difficult. They <strong>feel frustrated</strong>, and&nbsp;the frustration comes out as a tantrum. It is normal for toddlers to have tantrums, especially when they cannot do something they want. <strong>They need you to help them learn how to cope with strong emotions</strong>, support and encourage them to do new things and give them confidence in themselves. Once a child can talk more, they are less likely to have&nbsp;tantrums. Tantrums are far less common by about the age of four.<br />
                                &nbsp;<br />
                                <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/Behaviour/Temper.png" style="width: 70%; float: right;" /><br />
                                <br />
                                The following suggestions may help you to cope with tantrums when they happen:</span><br />
                            &nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Find out why the tantrum is happening.&nbsp;</strong>It could be that your child is tired or hungry, in which case the solution is very simple. Or they could be feeling frustrated or jealous, maybe of another child. They may need time, attention and love, even though they are not being very lovable!</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Understand and accept your child&rsquo;s anger.&nbsp;</strong>You probably feel the same way yourself at times but you can express it in other ways.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Find a distraction. &nbsp;</strong>If you can see that your child is starting a tantrum, find something to distract them straight away &ndash; for example, (&lsquo;Look, a cat!&rsquo;).</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Sit it out.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Losing your temper or shouting back will not make the tantrum end. Ignore the looks you get from people around you and concentrate on staying calm. &lsquo;Giving in&rsquo; will not help in the long term. If you have said &lsquo;no&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t change your mind and say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;just to end the tantrum. Otherwise, your child will start to think that tantrums pay. For the same reason, it doesn&rsquo;t help to buy your way out with sweets or treats. If you are at home, try going into another room for a while &ndash; but make sure your child cannot hurt themselves.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Be prepared when shopping.&nbsp;</strong>For some reason, tantrums often seem to happen in shops. Keep shopping trips short. You could start by going out to buy one or two things only, and build up from there. It can help to involve your child in the shopping by talking about what you need to buy and letting them help you.</span></li>
                            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Try holding your child firmly&nbsp;</strong><strong>until the tantrum passes.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>

                            <span style="font-size: 16px;">Smacking may stop a child doing what they are doing at that moment, but it will not&nbsp;have a lasting positive effect. <strong>Children learn by example,</strong> so if you hit your child, you are&nbsp;effectively telling them that hitting is an OK way to behave.</span><br /><br />

There are lots of&nbsp;<strong>alternatives to smacking</strong> as a way of controlling your child&rsquo;s behaviour.<br /><br /></span>

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">The basic definition of ADHD is &quot;a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparative level of development&quot;. The essential diagnostic criteria for ADHD demands that a child must be under seven years of age and demonstrate clear social and functioning impairment across more than one setting, for example, home and school, for more than six months. Diagnosis is often difficult because other problems, such as epilepsy, autism, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, anxiety, depression, and a range of learning difficulties, can result in similar behaviour to ADHD and/or mask symptoms.<br />

                                    This section summarises the issues raised by users and carers in relation to this topic, both as described by the literature and as defined through local consultation. Little research has been conducted in the UK into the opinions of parents or children about assessment and diagnosis of ADHD.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    A recent qualitative study to explore the views of parents of children with ADHD found that they felt theirviews about the causes of the disorder differed greatly from professionals and others. Parents felt blamed for their children&rsquo;s behaviour. They thought that others believed the disorder had a psychological and social basis, and so considered the parents to be responsible. They therefore aimed to encourage others to share their view that the disorder had a biological basis only. Thesedifferences of opinion were a cause of great distress to the parents.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Recent consultation with parents of children with ADHD, undertaken in the Trent region for this briefing, highlighted a number of additional issues. Parents felt that early formal diagnosis was important if any school-based orother provision was to be made, and if they were to be able to access potentially valuable means of support from social services, such as disability living allowance (DLA) and respite care. Some parents also reported that they benefited from help and support in completing the questionnaires designed to describe their child&rsquo;s behaviour.<br />

It also affects how you make sense of the world around you. Autism is not a mental health problem, but a study found that as many as 7 out of 10 people with autism also have a mental health problem such as anxiety, depression or OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).<br />

                                    Autism is known as a spectrum so some people are affected by it far more than others. Some autistic people have great difficulties with speech and communication and are not able to care for themselves or live independently. Some people with autism or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, which is a type of autism, may have very good language and communicating skills but lack social skills.<br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Most babies get their <strong>first milk tooth at around six months,</strong> usually in front and at the bottom. But all babies are different. Some are born with a tooth already through, while others still have no teeth by the time they are a year old. <strong>Most will have all their milk or primary teeth by about two-and-a-half. </strong>There are 20 primary teeth in all, 10 at the top and 10 at the bottom.The first permanent &lsquo;second&rsquo; teeth come through at the back at around the age of six.&nbsp;<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Some teeth come through with no pain </strong>or trouble at all. At other times you may notice that the gum is sore and red where the tooth is coming, or that one cheek is flushed. Your baby may dribble, gnaw and chew a lot, or just be fretful.<br />
                            <br />
                            <img alt="" src="styles/Photos/DentalHealth/Teething.png" style="width: 70%;" /><br />
                            <br />
                            It can help to <strong>give your baby something hard to chew on,</strong> such as a teething ring, a crust of bread or breadstick, or a peeled carrot (stay nearby in case of choking). It&rsquo;s best to avoid rusks because almost all brands contain some sugar.<br />
                            <br />
                            Constant chewing and sucking on sugary things can cause tooth decay even if your baby has only one or two teeth. For babies over four months old, <strong>you can try rubbing sugar-free teething gel on their gums.</strong> You can get this from the pharmacist.<br />
                            <br />
                            For younger babies,<strong> talk to your GP or health visitor.</strong> You may also want to give sugar-free baby paracetamol or ibuprofen. Follow the instructions on the bottle for your child&rsquo;s age, or check with your pharmacist, GP or health visitor.<br />
                            <br />
                            It can be tempting to put all sorts of things &ndash; rashes, crying, bad temper, runny noses, extra-dirty nappies &ndash; down to teething. <strong>If you are unsure about your child&rsquo;s health, seek advice.</strong></span><br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Brushing their teeth is an important part of your child&rsquo;s daily routine, so they continue the healthy habit as they get older.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Start to brush your baby&#39;s teeth, using a baby toothbrush, as soon as they begin to come through.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Gradually start brushing your child&rsquo;s teeth more thoroughly. Make sure you clean all the tooth surfaces. Your child&rsquo;s teeth should be brushed twice a day; last thing at night before bed and at least one other time.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Use a small-headed child&rsquo;s toothbrush suitable for your child&rsquo;s age.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">The amount of toothpaste also depends on your child&rsquo;s age. For children under age three, use a smear or thin film of toothpaste that covers less than three-quarters of the brush. For children aged three to six, use no more than a pea-sized blob of toothpaste.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">When your child has finished brushing, encourage them to spit out the toothpaste that&rsquo;s left, but not to rinse their mouth with lots of water.</span></li>
                            <li>
                                <span style="font-size: 16px;">Don&rsquo;t let your child eat or lick toothpaste from the tube.</span></li>

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Incubation period: </strong>15&ndash;20 days.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Infectious period: </strong>From one week before the rash first appears until at least five days after.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Symptoms: </strong>Can be difficult to diagnose with certainty. Starts like a mild cold. The rash appears in a day or two, first on the face, then spreading. Spots are flat. On a light skin, they are pale pink. Glands in the back of the neck may be swollen. Your child will not usually feel unwell.<br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>What to do: </strong>Give plenty to drink, and keep your child away from anybody you know who is trying to get pregnant or is up to four months pregnant. If your child was with anyone pregnant before you knew about the illness, you will need to let the woman know. If an unimmunised pregnant woman catches German measles in the first four months of pregnancy, there is a risk of damage to her baby.&nbsp;</span><br />

                        <h3>Chickenpox</h3>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Incubation period: </strong>10&ndash;23 days.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Infectious period: </strong>From four days before the rash appears to five days after.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Starts with feeling unwell, a rash and maybe a slight temperature. Spots are red and become fluid-filled blisters within a day or so and eventually dry into scabs which drop off. Spots appear first on the chest and back and then spread. Spots will not leave scars unless badly infected.<br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>What to do</strong>: You don&rsquo;t need to go to your GP or to A&amp;E unless you are not sure whether it&rsquo;s chickenpox, or your child is very unwell and/or distressed. Give them plenty to drink. Paracetamol or ibuprofen will relieve discomfort and fever. Baths, loose comfortable clothes and calamine lotion can all ease the itchiness. Try to stop your child scratching or picking at their spots, as this will increase the risk of scarring. It&rsquo;s hard for children to do this, so give them lots of praise and encouragement. Distractions, like TV, are good for taking their mind off it. Let the school or nursery know in case other children are at risk.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Incubation period</strong>: 7 - 12 days.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Infectious period</strong>: From a few days before the rash appears until four days after.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Symptoms</strong>: Begins like a bad cold and cough with sore, watery eyes. Child becomes gradually more unwell, with a temperature. Rash appears after third or fourth day. Spots are red and slightly raised; they may be blotchy, but not itchy. Begins behind the ears, and spreads to the face and neck and then the rest of the body. Children can become very unwell, with a cough and high temperature. The illness usually lasts about a week. Measles is much more serious than chickenpox, German measles or mumps, and is best prevented (by the MMR immunisation). Serious complications include pneumonia and death.<br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>What to do</strong>: Your child will be quite unwell, so make sure they get lots of rest and plenty to drink. Warm drinks will ease the cough, and paracetamol or ibuprofen will ease discomfort and fever. You could also put Vaseline around their lips to protect their skin. If their eyelids are crusty, wash it away with warm water. If your child is having trouble breathing, is coughinga lot or seems drowsy, see your GP urgently.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Incubation period: </strong>14&ndash;25 days.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Infectious period: </strong>From a few days before starting to feel unwell until the swelling goes down.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Symptoms: </strong>At first, your child may be slightly unwell with a bit of fever, and may complain of pain around the ear or feeling uncomfortable when chewing. Swelling then starts on the side of the face, in front of the ear and under the chin. Swelling often starts on one side, followed (though not always) by the other. Your child&rsquo;s face will be back to normal size in about a week. It&rsquo;s rare for mumps to affect boys&rsquo; testes (balls). This happens rather more often in adult men with mumps. If you think your child&rsquo;s testes are swollen or painful see your GP.<br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>What to do: </strong>Your child may not feel especially ill and may not want to be in bed. Paracetamol or ibuprofen will ease pain in the swollen glands. Check the package for the correct dosage. Give plenty to drink, but not fruit juices as they make the saliva flow, which can hurt and make your child&rsquo;s pain worse. There is no need to see your GP unless your child has stomach ache and is being sick, or develops a rash of small red/purple spots or bruises.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>(also known as fifth disease or slapped cheek disease)</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Incubation period: </strong>Anywhere between 1 and 20 days.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Infectious period: </strong>For a few days until the rash appears.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Symptoms: </strong>Begins with a fever and nasal discharge. A bright red rash, like the mark left by a slap, appears on the cheeks. Over the next two to four days, a lacy type of rash spreads to the trunk and limbs. Although it is most common in children, the disease can occur in adults. In the majority of cases it has no serious consequences. Children with blood disorders such as spherocytosis or sickle cell disease may become more anaemic and should seek medical care. Rarely, in pregnant women who are not immune to the disease, it may affect the baby in the uterus.<br />

                        <h3>Whooping cough</h3>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Incubation period: </strong>&nbsp;5-21 days.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Infectious period: </strong>From the first signs of the illness until about six weeks after coughing first starts. If an antibiotic is given, the infectious period will continue for up to five days after starting treatment.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Symptoms: </strong>Begins like a cold and cough. The cough gradually gets worse. After about two weeks, extended bouts of coughing start. These are exhausting and make it difficult to breathe. Younger children (babies under six months) are much more seriously affected and can have breath-holding or blue attacks, even before the cough symptoms. Your child may choke and vomit. Sometimes, but not always, there will be a whooping noise as the child draws in breath after coughing. The coughing fits may not die down for several weeks and can continue for three months.<br />
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>What to do: </strong>Whooping cough is best prevented, through immunisation. If your child has a cough that gets worse rather than better and starts to have longer fits of coughing more and more often, see your GP. It&rsquo;s important for the sake of other children to know whether or not it&rsquo;s whooping cough. Talk to your GP about how best to look after your child and avoid contact with babies, who are most at risk from serious complications.</span><br />

                                <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><u>How long will it take for my uterus to shrink?</u></strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>By the time you go into labour, your uterus is about 15 times heavier &ndash;&nbsp;not including its contents!</strong> &ndash; 
                                        and its capacity is at least 500 times greater than before you conceived.<strong> Within minutes after your baby is born, contractions cause your 
                                        uterus to shrink, clenching itself like a fist, its crisscrossed fibers tightening just like they did during labour.</strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    These contractions cause the placenta to separate from the uterine wall. After the placenta is delivered, the uterus clamps down even more, 
                                    closing off open blood vessels where the placenta was attached. <strong>As the uterus continues to contract, you may feel cramps known as after pains.</strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    For the first couple of days after giving birth, you can feel the top of your uterus at or a few finger widths below the level of your belly button. 
                                        <strong>In a week, your uterus weighs a little over a pound &ndash; half of what it weighed just after you gave birth.</strong> After two weeks, 
                                        it&#39;s down to a mere 11 ounces and located entirely within your pelvis. <strong>By about four weeks, it should be close to its pre-pregnancy weight 
                                        of 3.5 ounces or less. This process is called involution of the uterus.</strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    Even after your uterus shrinks back into your pelvis, you may continue to look somewhat pregnant for several weeks or longer. 
                                    That&#39;s because your abdominal muscles get stretched out during pregnancy, and <strong>it will take time &ndash; and regular 
                                    exercise&nbsp;&ndash; to get your belly back in shape.</strong></span><br />

                                    <strong>You probably won&#39;t return to your pre-pregnancy weight for some time,</strong> but you will lose a significant amount of weight immediately
                                    after delivery. Subtracting one 7- to 8-pound baby, about a pound or so of placenta, and another few pounds of blood and amniotic fluid leaves most 
                                    new moms about 12 pounds lighter.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>The weight keeps coming off, too. All the extra water your cells retained during pregnancy, along with fluid from the extra blood you had in 
                                     your pregnant body, will be looking for a way out.</strong><br />
                                    So you&#39;ll <strong>produce more urine than usual in the days after birth </strong>&ndash; an astounding 3 quarts a day. You may perspire a lot, too.
                                     By the end of the first week, you&#39;ll likely lose about 4 to 6 pounds of water weight. (The amount varies depending on how much water you retained 
                                     during pregnancy.)</span><br />

                                        You may not feel the usual urge to pee in the first days after you give birth, especially if you had a prolonged labor, a </span>

This is also more likely if you had trouble urinating during labour and had to be catheterized.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        But <strong>with all the extra fluid your kidneys are processing, your bladder fills up rapidly, so it&#39;s essential to give yourself a chance to urinate frequently</strong> even if you don&#39;t feel the urge to. If too much urine accumulates in your bladder, you might have a hard time making it to the toilet without leaking. What&#39;s more, your bladder could become overly distended. This can cause urinary problems and also makes it harder for your uterus to contract, leading to more after pains&nbsp;and bleeding.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>If you can&#39;t pee within a few hours after giving birth, a catheter will be put in to drain the urine from your bladder. (If you deliver by c-section, you&#39;ll have a urinary catheter for the surgery, which will remain in place for a short while after delivery.)</strong><br />
                                        <br />
                                        <strong>Let the midwife while in hospital and the Community Midwife know if you&#39;re having difficulty urinating</strong> or are only producing a small amount of urine when you pee. If your bladder gets too full, it can actually keep you from being able to urinate.</span></span><br />

This dryness will be even more pronounced if you&#39;re breastfeeding, because nursing tends to keep estrogen levels down. <strong>Using a lubricant is a big help. </strong>(Be sure to buy a water-based lubricant, particularly if you&#39;re using a barrier method of contraception.<strong> Oil-based lubricants can weaken latex, which can cause a condom to break or ruin a diaphragm.)</strong></span></span><br />

If these measures don&#39;t help and your baby seems to be having trouble latching on correctly, talk to your Health Visitor or lactation consultant.</span></span><br />

                                <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><u>What will it be like if I&#39;m <em>not</em> breastfeeding?</u></strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    If you&#39;re not breastfeeding, <strong>you&#39;ll still begin to produce milk,</strong> and a few days after you give birth, your breasts will become engorged. This may cause considerable discomfort that lasts for several days. The pain tends to peak three to five days after you give birth.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In the meantime, <strong>wear a supportive bra around the clock and put cold packs on your breasts, which will ease the swelling and help inhibit milk production.</strong> (Be sure to cover the cold packs with cloth to protect your skin.) It can take several weeks for your milk to dry up completely.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <strong>If you need to, you can take Paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief. </strong>If you&#39;re extremely uncomfortable, you can express just enough milk to make the situation more tolerable. This may prolong the process, however, because stimulating your nipples and draining your breasts signals your body to make more milk. <strong>Avoid applying warmth to your breasts since this, too, can encourage milk production.</strong></span></span><br />

                                    <br />
                                    Kegels <strong>are exercises you can do to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles </strong>&ndash; the muscles that support your urethra, bladder, uterus, and rectum. The exercises are named after <strong>Arnold Kegel, a gynecologist who recommended them back in the 1940s to help women with urinary incontinence, or diminished bladder control, which can happen after childbirth.</strong><br />
                                    <br />
                                    If you&#39;re not already doing Kegel exercises, <strong>start them now.</strong> Strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent or treat<strong> </strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-urinary-incontinence_1152241.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">urinary stress incontinence</a><span style="color: #000000;">, a problem that affects up to 70 percent of women during or after pregnancy. Kegel exercises may also help reduce the risk of </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-anal-incontinence_1157264.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">anal incontinence</a></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>.</strong><br />
                                        <br />
                                        Because Kegels<strong> improve circulation to your rectal and vaginal area,</strong> they may help keep </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_hemorrhoids-during-pregnancy_244.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">hemorrhoids</a><span style="color: #000000;"> at bay and possibly speed healing after an </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_episiotomy_165.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">episiotomy</a><span style="color: #000000;"> or </span><a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.babycenter.com/0_perineal-tears_1451354.bc', '_blank', 'location=yes,EnableViewPortScale=yes');">tear</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"> during childbirth. Finally, continuing to do Kegel exercises regularly after giving birth not only helps you maintain bladder control, it also improves the muscle tone of your vagina, making sex more enjoyable.<br />
                                            &nbsp;<br />
                                            &nbsp;<br />
                                            <strong><u>How do I do them?</u></strong><br />
                                            <br />
                                            Start with an empty bladder. Imagine that you&#39;re trying to stop yourself from passing gas and trying to stop the flow of urine midstream at the same time. The feeling is one of &quot;squeeze and lift&quot; &ndash; a closing and drawing up of the front and back passages.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            If you&#39;re not sure you&#39;ve got it, one way to check is by inserting a clean finger into your vagina before doing a Kegel. If you feel pressure around your finger, you&#39;re on the right track. Or try a Kegel during lovemaking and ask your partner if he can feel it. If you&#39;re doing it correctly, he&#39;ll be able to feel you &quot;hug&quot; his penis.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Make sure that you&#39;re squeezing and lifting without pulling in your tummy, squeezing your legs together, tightening your buttocks, or holding your breath. In other words, only your pelvic floor muscles should be working.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Though you may have trouble isolating these muscles at first, it gets easier with practice. It might help to place a hand on your belly while you&#39;re doing your Kegels to make sure that it stays relaxed.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            If you haven&#39;t been doing Kegels, start by holding each contraction for a few seconds before releasing, and relax for a few seconds after each one. As your muscles get stronger, you&#39;ll want to work up to holding each Kegel for ten seconds, then relaxing for ten seconds after each one. If you&#39;re suffering from urinary incontinence, try to hold a Kegel while you sneeze, cough, or lift something. You may find that it helps keep you from leaking.</span></span><br />

                        <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Enduring the stresses of pregnancy and giving birth are only half of what it takes to become a parent. The other half involves <strong>adjusting emotionally to the reality of a newborn.</strong> With tips on<strong> getting outside help and &quot;discussion points&quot; useful in self&ndash;therapy, Becoming a Parent offers real&ndash;life solutions, based on actual cases, to every sort of difficulty new parents might expect.</strong></span></span><br />

                        <h3>Evidence based theory</h3>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why is it important? </strong>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong><em>&ldquo;It is one thing to know what methods work, quite another to understand why. Without understanding why they work we are most unlikely to use them effectively.&rdquo; Geoff Petty, Evidence Based Teaching (2006)&nbsp;</em></strong><br />
                            <br />
                            Evidence-based parenting programmes are underpinned by sound theoretical principles that have been supported by a substantial amount of research in the field of child development. While a variety of models have informed the development of parenting programmes, four core theories underpin the majority of them:</span></span><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">social learning theory</span></span></strong></li>
                            <li>
                                <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">attachment theory</span></span></strong></li>
                            <li>
                                <strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;">parenting styles theory</span></span></strong></li>
                            <li>

                        </ul>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Social learning theory</strong> is based on the assumption that children&rsquo;s behaviour will improve when appropriately reinforced - good behaviour is rewarded and bad behaviour is either ignored or appropriately sanctioned.<br />
                            Social learning theory-based programmes teach parents strategies for dealing with child misconduct, such as time out and withholding privileges, and encouraging positive behaviour through proactive reward systems, such as sticker charts and point systems.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Attachment theory</strong> is based on the notion that an infant&rsquo;s ability to form a strong emotional bond with their primary caregiver is a natural part of its development. The security of this bond, also known as attachment security, is largely determined by the parent&rsquo;s ability to respond sensitively and appropriately to their infant&rsquo;s bids for attention. Programmes based on attachment theory therefore aim to improve parental sensitivity by increasing parents&rsquo; understanding of their children&rsquo;s needs and attachment related behaviours.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Parenting styles theory</strong> is based on research that suggests children&rsquo;s behaviour is directly related to their parent&rsquo;s child-rearing practices. Parents who combine high levels of parental warmth with high levels of supervision are more likely to have children who are more confident, more autonomous and more socially responsible.<br />
                            <br />
                            This parenting style is often referred to as an <em>authoritative</em> style of parenting, as it recognises the child as an individual in his or her own right and promotes personal responsibility. For this reason, many parenting programmes include elements which encourage parents to allow their children to take risks within a family environment amidst high levels of supervision.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>The model of human ecology</strong> assumes that a child&rsquo;s development is determined by his or her interaction within the nested environments of the individual, family, school, community and culture. Each of these environments contains elements (also known as protective and risk factors) which can either improve a child&rsquo;s life outcomes or place them at risk for adversity. Every family is unique in terms of the risk and protective factors influencing it. Programmes based on this model consider ways to strengthen protective factors in order to reduce or remove any ongoing risks.<br />

                            <br />
                            Children are children. They will be messy, noisy and at times, disobedient. A two year old will behave differently from a seven or ten year old. Give them the freedom to make mistakes and take risks.<br />

                            <br />
                            If you <strong>make sure you get a break to relax,</strong> or to go out, then you will be in better shape to cope with everything. Get together with other parents &ndash; children often feel happier if they have a friend for company. Don&rsquo;t be shy to ask for help. Nobody gets it right all the time. It can help to talk things over with family or friends, and they will often be able to help out in practical ways, too.<br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>&nbsp;Anorexia nervosa</strong>, also known as anorexia, is a serious eating disorder where you are worried about your weight, 
                        you want to lose weight and you eat less and less food.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            You think about calorie intake and maybe excessive exercising too. You avoid eating to try and take control in some way. Maybe you have lots of things going on in your 
                        life that you can&rsquo;t control and what you eat is one thing that you feel you are in control of. You may judge yourself on what you eat and feel you have &lsquo;
                        let yourself down&rsquo; if you have eaten what is in your eyes too much. Other people may tell you that you are thin but you think you are fat.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            <strong>Symptoms of anorexia include:</strong> Losing a lot of weight quickly, eating less and less food, thinking about the calorie content of food, 
                        feeling panicky about eating food with other people or having a big meal. You may feel moody or irritable because of the lack of food and your periods 
                        (as a woman) may stop, while men stop having erections. You may become obsessed with everyone else&rsquo;s body size and compare yourself to them. You may feel cold a 
                        lot of the time and grow a downy hair on your body.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Bulimia</strong></span><br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">People with bulimia are very concerned about their weight and because they want to control their weight they are trapped in a cycle of 
                        binge eating and then making themselves sick or taking laxatives to get rid of the food.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Anxiety is the feeling of fear or panic. Most people feel anxious, panicky or fearful about situations in life, such as money problems
                        &nbsp;but often once the difficult situation is over, you&nbsp;feel better and calmer. Sometimes the feelings of fear or anxiety continue after the difficult situation 
                        or sometimes you may feel a&nbsp;stronger sense of fear than other people and this is when anxiety becomes a problem and can affect you doing every day things</span><br />

                        If you have ADHD it means you may find it difficult to concentrate on something for a long time, you may have a lot of energy and say or do things without thinking. 
                        It makes it very difficult for you to control your behaviour.<br />
                            <br />
                            You may have heard of ADD which stands for Attention Deficit Disorder which is where you have similar symptoms but you don&rsquo;t have the hyperactivity so you 
                        don&rsquo;t have quite so much energy. The main problem for people with ADD is poor concentration.</span><br />

                            Autism is known as a spectrum so some people are affected by it far more than others. Some autistic people have great difficulties with speech and communication and are not able to care for themselves or live independently. Some people with autism or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, which is a type of autism, may have very good language and communicating skills but lack social skills.<br />

But some people feel sad, lonely, down, anxious or stressed for longer periods of time to the extent that it can affect their everyday lives and can prevent that person from doing things they would normally do.

                        This can sound very scary, especially if you don&rsquo;t know much about mental health, but in the same way that sometimes we get physically sick with a cold, flu or 
                        poorly tummy, sometimes we get mentally ill too.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            In fact, one in four people in the UK will experience a mental health problem in a year so it is really quite common and about 10 per cent of children have a mental 
                        health problem at any one time. In the same way that you can get help from the doctor when you have the flu, you can get help from the doctor when you have a mental

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or OCD is a serious anxiety related disorder (see our pages on anxiety) and &nbsp;people experiencing OCD may have obsessions about something, followed by repetitive compulsions or urges to do something. If you have OCD you might get horrible thoughts in your mind such as something awful happening to your family, and urges to do rituals like repeated hand washing, counting things or repeating the same action to try and make things better or stop this horrible thing from happening.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />

                            You might develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) if you experience something where you feel really frightened, helpless or like you might die. 
                        You could experience PTSD if you have been involved in or witnessed an accident or if you have been abused or raped. Many people who experience horrible things 
                        recover without experiencing PTSD but some people do develop it.</span><br />

                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health problem which affects your thoughts, feelings and behaviour.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            If you have schizophrenia, you may have a range of different symptoms which include hallucinations, delusions, confused thoughts and a change in behaviour. 
                        People who have schizophrenia may find it difficult to tell the difference between their own thoughts and reality. Schizophrenia is known as a psychotic illness 
                        because people experience hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is not about having a split personality.</span><br />

                        <h3>Self-harm</h3>
                        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Self-harming is when a person chooses to inflict pain on themselves in some way. If you are self-harming, you may be cutting or burning 
                        yourself, biting your nails excessively, developing an eating disorder or taking an overdose of tablets. It can also include taking drugs or excessive amounts of alcohol. 
                        It is usually a sign that something is wrong.<br />
                            <br />
                            You may self-harm if you are feeling anxious, depressed or stressed or if you are being bullied and feel that you do not have a support network or way to deal with your 
                        problems. The issues then &lsquo;build up&rsquo; to the point where you feel like you are going to explode. People who self-harm often talk about the &lsquo;
                        release&rsquo; that they feel after they have self-harmed, as they use it as a mechanism to cope with their problems.<br />
                            &nbsp;<br />
                            You may self-harm to relieve tension, to try and gain control of the issues that may be concerning you or to punish yourself. Sometimes in severe cases it is an 
                        attempt to commit suicide if the problems are very severe.</span><br />
